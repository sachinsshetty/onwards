## This Day, Everyday

When your drifting against the tide of fate,
Without the light tower to guide against peril
The might of catastrophe, whether external or self-inflicted, will throw us astray

Change the direction of the sails,
Build strength slowly beating the small waves occuring everyday
When the next big wave comes crashing,
Change the direction of the force towards your own guiding light/night star.

This day, take cognisance of your fortitude
Keep fixing one problem at a time.
Make sure to master it, to never return ever again

Build your mental map for the wprlds,
Clear your cobwebs, knock down the unnecessary and invisible luggage pulling you down.

Choose to fight a single problem,
Not all the problems of the world can be fixed by yourself alone.
Make today and everyday, Your playground.
