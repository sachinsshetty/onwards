## Alive

When your hope are down
When misery has gripped you tightly
When the world seems running away
When old dreams reamain unfulfilled
When your stuck against the wall

Notice,
That you are still alive,
That you can breathe the air
That you can remake your dreams
That past experiences were experiments,

Remember,
Each journey will have its own path and time
Each result, either success/failure can be restarted with the next attempt
Each life is precious, 
A few years presumably wasted/lost, does not mean a life of failure

Pick up, wherever you are,
Do, whatever you wished
Be, the person you dreamt to be 
You are Alive, You are the pilot of your spacecraft,
Reach for the stars
