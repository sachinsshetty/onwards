## Great

I want to be Great,
I do not want to apologize to anyone
I do not want to beg to anyone
I do not want to have any excuses for work
I want to become credible, i want to have consistency
I will not take things for granted and waste my time
I will leave behind distractions from news and social media
I will only concentrate on my main line of work
I will not lose focus trying to catch up with the world
I will not lose my chance at acheiving greatness
I will follow a regimenm, I will forge ahead
I will learn from others, this way i will build myself stronger
I want to be lean and strong
I will not repeat the mistakes of my life
