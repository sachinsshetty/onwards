## Declaration of War

Excuses have been flying continously.
Debts are piling due to wrong actions
Interest wanes off without dedication.

How is it, that even the basic things are not understood leading to problems
Using the easiest solution is leading to testable outcomes

There are no shortcuts, no quickfixes.
Get the ball rolling, do not apologize for new mistakes and avoiding creating issues.

We will try a 100 different tasks, but we will not stop trying to win
Become consistent, its the easiest way to come out of the current predicament &
All future problems if not handled

No more excuses, no running away
We create our destiny today, yet again for a brave new world
