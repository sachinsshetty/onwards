## De-addiction Game

Begin with the end in mind
Stop readinf the news, stop reading exaggerated fiction
Instead read biographies, research papers
Solve puzzles to keep mind active
Know the problem, that is holding you back
Use your memory recall power to solve problems, rather than day dreaming

You cannot rewind the past to fix mistakes,
Instead work on today, so that your future pathway is not derailed.

You have to become better than what you did last year.
So do today, what you wish to be in the future.
