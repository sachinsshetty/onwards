## 1 Step

Move ahead, its time to get up and crawl
We have fallen again, embracing the darkness & hiding from reality
Without work, riches are impossible
Do not skip any responsibility
Take one step today, Clean the cobwebs of Brain
Create the future, failures are repeating with same actions.

Reject the wrong way of work,
Get going slowly, Walk, crawl, run, waddle
The ship encounter mighty storms all the way to reach their ports,
Do not be disheartened, Life is not over
Its a new day again, Do the necessary first,
Focus on the most important work,
Get fit, became a responsible & disciplined person.
