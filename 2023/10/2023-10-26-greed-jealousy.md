## Greed / Jealousy

A month ago, life was in complete doldrums
Unemployment had persisted for many months.
There was no food nor money to pass the weeks and days

A new opportunity presented itself in a different region, 
money for expenses which did not exist for stay, travel and sustenance.

A hail mary cry for alms was sent to remaining friends,
those who could, helped at the moment,
provided relief and hope to live again

Major roadblocks seemed to have passed in the month,
with the arrival of salary for the job as oasis in the desert.

Wish was fulfilled to live another day,
A warm bed, food for the day, roof over my head &
Job to work is what one would dream & wish  in the depth of despair.

The mind/self is a strange creature,
the good message of a friend, seems to put life into jealousy.

One now starts to count the regrets/gift of the things not available in comparison.
A month ago, life was in the teethering edge of homelessness &
One just wanted to exit poverty,
But now one wishes to have a mansion, a luxury car without putting the necessary efforts.

Greed and ego should be kpe in check,
Life has been good till now.
Now is the time to work ahead for a better tomorrow.
Doing the right things should be of paramount importance
