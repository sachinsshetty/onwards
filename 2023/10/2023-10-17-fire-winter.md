## Fire of Winter

Winter challenges you to become better
You prepare and fight against it everyday
There cannot be any complacency, 
there is no optional part to overlook.

All it needs is a small way/opening &
It will engulf you completely.

I will start the day strong, with a prayer for the soul
Exercise to get the blood flowing, 
a hot shower to banish the cold away from the bones.
A journal entry to kickstart the morning with a purpose.
