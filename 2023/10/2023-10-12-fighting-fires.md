## Fighting fires

Running out of wells and will, to fight the Fire
Entropy will work against doing nothing
There is no neutral behavior,
The world does not stop, if you close your eyes and wish for the problems to disapper
Tides wait for nobody, they will keep beating at the rocks &
Erode it slowly first and then pulverize it.

Plans for the fires, remove the fallen leaves regularly.
Cleanup the wrong acts, do not allow misery to seep in.

Every small things matter, Do not neglect the small problems.
A mold at the corner can destabilize the entire building if left unchecked.

You can cry world, only a fixed number of times
If you do not work it, Nobody else will turn up to fix things &
You cannot keep blaming the world.
