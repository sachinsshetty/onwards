## Ego Fallout

Do not let Ego pull you dowb
Dont let others success, diminish your own life
Your life can be improved, stick to the simple rules
Its you against yesterday, against last year

Need to prove myself for a life of contentment,
Dedicated effort to be at the top spot.
Set life for a distinguished living and service
Build your own framework for competitiveness

Make everyday count, set hard targets for a higher goal in life,
By accomplishing small wins everyday.
