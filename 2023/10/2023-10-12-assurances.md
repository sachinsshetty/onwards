## Assurances

Do not carry a heavyweight everytime
Take some time off for yourself too
We get lost in meeting others expectations

Every obstacles we have faced and will face in the future,
Will become a step to climb when we look back

Life is not supposed to be difficult everytime.
Its ok to drop heavy bags on the way.
Every new day, a different way to live again.
