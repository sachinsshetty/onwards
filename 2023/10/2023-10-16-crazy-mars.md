## Crazy for Mars

To make a lasting change, One needs crazy amount of focus towards a single goal
All my life, have been running across different problems, distracted by pleasures derailing effort.

Let me follow a crazy plan to Mars,
Learn everything about spacecraft, Become great at Operation.
Solve problems for every obstacle, be hands-on.

Most of the time, the solution is right in front of eyes. But one was distracted by a passing moment.
Let today, be the zero-day.
We need to aggressively pursue Human Spaceflight,
Learn and practive from Astronauts routine.
Become knowledgeable, be source of ideas &
Force of implementation. 
Get things done, Do not hide's ones talents.

Be relentless resourceful. 
To the dreams, that stay in one's palm when pursued.
