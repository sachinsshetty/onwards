## Onwards

Onwards towards somewhere,
The path is misty at the start,
Daily progress, making a few dents at the edges
It takes a while to get the entire picture,
Knock around a few things,
Pick up broken pieces.
Leaving behind missed opportunities,
making diverse memories, some joyous,
But the harsh one's seem to linger and reappear at difficult times.
How simple to blame circumstances for failure,
How easy to accept accolades for success without circumstances.
Memories long forgotten, for hope of a better tomorrow.
