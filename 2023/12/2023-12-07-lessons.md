# Lessons

Life has simple lessons for everyone,
To understand, identify challenges 
It keeps recurring unless the the challenge is solved.

Surviving everyday has a complex set of tasks to master for living better.
Keeping the living area hygienic.
The loop will run forever.

Be grateful for whatever existence has thrown at us.
Good things will pass, as well as the difficult times.
Avoid vices like the plague, it makes no sense to follow a path 
Which is known to devastate anything in its path.

There are better ways to live.
