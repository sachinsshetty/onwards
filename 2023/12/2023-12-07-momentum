# Momentum

Use gravity, carefully fire thrusters
To find optimal trajectory to reach the orbit

Start from current poistion,
Update your direction with the rught path,
Do not lost momentum by making wasteful burns.

You know now your destination,
Avoid everything that will take you astray.
Work on the most important and difficult problem.
You time and skills should be premium

There is a way out of any problem,
Look at the long picture, you can always take it forward.
