# Motivation to Discipline

To get ahead in any aspect of live
One needs to develop good habits,
Foremost being discipline of work and health

Doing the hard task, the boring work that gets the job done
Will be rewarding in the long run.

Build the things, that people want to use.
It would make their work less difficult, reducing friction.

Your project should not boast of its tech,
But of its usefulness to the target users.

Cultivate the habit of requesting feedback from multiple levels
Make sure you are not building a useless product 
that does not solve any actual problem,
But it was some hypothetical problem that never was.

Everyday progress will bring the necessary discipline.
Build organically, rigorously validate your progress.
Build fast, break things and fix them along the way.
