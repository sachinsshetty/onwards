## Fire and Dust

Start with whatever knowledge you have,
One can never have complete and perfect info,
We have to keep updating as things are necessary to change and fix direction
Build a large fire to sustain your journey,
Your habits and discipline will make you a unstoppable face,

You cannot reclaim your past or every any failure & regrets that are built
You can only claim the present and use it for best possible outcome with progress
Any task requires mastery, focus on a single goal
Pursue it relentlessly every day and test tour growth with tracking and competition

Come out of your shell, unshackle your chains of comfort and discuss.
Each one has a fire inside us, one needs to keep it burning with a sense of urgency
And with attention to detail

Burn with fury to become your dreams.
