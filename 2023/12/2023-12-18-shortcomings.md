## Shortcomings

I thought my problems were overwhelming,
But when i ventured out of my comfort zone
I saw someone physically challenged with a smile on their face
They did not allow circumstances to overcome their life
My life is flawless compared to them,
Utilise your gifts for betterment of life.

Ready to fight again,
The days ends, bringing back the night and cold with it.
Each day is an opportunity to live reducing fear of the future
The worry burned at darkness, with good work accomplished during the day.
