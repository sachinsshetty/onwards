## Embrace Divinity

There is an unstopaable life force inside us.
Do not let it flicker away with the worldly forces pushing it around.
Embrace the power, fuel its existnce.
You get to live only once, do your work.
In search of others, you have lost yourself.
Become the light of the world, Do no become the firefly,
that gets attracted to every light that comes in its path.

You have the power to move mountains,
the power to reach the Earth's Moon. 
Mankind has done it before, Surely you can do it too.

Choose the hard problems, make sure every action is toward solving the exploration of the cosmos.
We are made of stardust, lets also fet close to another puzzle of the Universe.

Let of the unseen shackles, the habits invisible to our minds which drains out the sould each day.

Add one step every day, you would have moved mountains in a Year.
Embrace the Divinity in You.
