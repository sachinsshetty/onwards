## Can i Dream, Again ?

Can i make my Dream come true, Again ?
Are you done, with life's problems
Do you see yourself out of the rut,
Can you breathe without being perennially suffocated
Do you think you are left behind.

Make things possible with simple work
The space farer dreams is possible with constant push
Keep the direction in the right angle, you will eventually reach there.

Compound your actions, build day by day.
Its ok, if you are a decade behind.
You have a decade of experience of what not to do.

Now put your ideas into practice,
Bootstrap your ideas into reality.
Dont be bogged down by life's curves.
Excuses are no longer necessary.

Take a step ahead, slowly build.
Plant the seed today, see it grow into a mighty forest.
