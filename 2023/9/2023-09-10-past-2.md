## Past 2

Music that we grew up in our adolescence years will carry forever with us life.

As i look back into my life,
I can either label myself as a failure counting all the mistakes and losses,
Or i can lable myself as fortunate,
being able to overcome the loss inadvertantly through sheer luck and support.

Each door that opens in a day can either be an opportunity or a disaster
Do i stop openings the door and stop life for fear failure repeating
Or do i take chance at any opportunity that could help cope with the losses.

I can accept life as it comes,
but without some direction it will lead to downfall.

We need to look out for danger while walking the street, cycling on the road
Eating the food on the plate, the air that we breather and the actions we take.

A small innocous misstep could lead to cascading effects of misery. 
Each one of us, has to grow & live with restrictions and boundaries.

Where we are born, whom we are born to, 
How we are born is uncontrollable metric,
but after a period of life. We get to choose how we live going forward.

Reduce the variables in life, Strike out the leakages & past actions have created problems. Its unwise to repeat the same actions & pray that it will lead to a different outcome.

Tomorrow will come, do equip today with a better way to live.
Remove inaction and lead with positive action.
