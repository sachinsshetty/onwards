## Past

With Covid implosion, jobs loss led to visa rejection
Fear creeped into paralysis of life
Debts piled in enormously,
When an opportunity comes up, A lot of work got done

Fear of unfulfilled dream & greed led to accumulation of additional debts.
With a distracted mind, circumstance led to job loss & another round of paralysis.

There is a mountain of debts, but there is also a way to climb it.
One step, one week, one month at a time.

Falling into the abyss, being forever saved by family
Getting hooked to TV during exams to beat stress was /is precursor to failures.
