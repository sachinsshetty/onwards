## One Problem

Life becomes a disaster while typing to fix a million problems
We are overwhelmed by the magnitude of all the problems in the world.
We see the inability to fix certain things as total failure &
Go to the place of darkness where we are unable to get anything done.

Stop assuming responsibility for every problem
Instead take only a single problem to tackle each day.
This problem need not be grandiose. It need not win an award/ accredition/ praise from everyone else.
Build yoir solution in silence, stake out the plan meticulously.
Read in-depth about the problem, become the master in your field.

The world has a million problems, There are 7 billion people to handle them,
Crawl out of your misery, one step at a time.

As long as you are alive, your problems can be conquered.
There have been many doors closed and opportunities squandered.
Rather than reminiscing of the things lost, Work on tackling the next opportunity.

Make your own luck, There are no shortcuts to a well lived life, go slowly but surely.
