Track Me Not - Fast Conjunction Analysis and Coverage Tracker

Predict collision paths for real-time conjunction avoidance with on-board computing. Extend the algorithm to  Predict and track which satellites are over-head at any location for amateur radio telemetry.

We upgrade pass-predict to ingest historical data from space-track.org/SATNOGS and make massive real-time calculations to generate live Map of all satellites and Objects of Interest.
Use the predicated path of Satellites amateur radio/ can select to listed to Satellites overhead and plan for maintenance.
