TimeBox

- Time and attention is a precious resource
- You have to prioritise work based on effort and rewards
- Many time, we miss out on opportunities for lack of time management.
- Vigorously guide your schedules, 
    - make it think/reasoning heavy in the morning
    - Replies to email/DM/messages can be done after 12 / Setup filter to not miss priority
- Take a shot at every new opportunity each day for an hour. Learning by doing new things should be a top item
- There is always someone who has experimented more and solved a problem, talk to creators and build alongside
