Spice - Thoughts

The Spice must flow,
control the means of production for all activities.
Build your tools of creation for a beautiful and wonderful new world. 

Thoughts and ideas about the world, create a mini version of the world in our mind.
We can tweak it a million times, constantly updating it with new information and learning rules by observation.

Set your course for this life, inspite of prior setbacks and current misadventures and state of life.
There is always a way out of the situation. In a year/6 months/ 1 month, you can be an entirely new person.

Fresh morning air, long walks in solitude with just our own minds for company, clean environment.
That is all that you need, it will be difficult giving up comfort and laziness. 
Choose intensive bootcamp now rather an old-age home later. 

Technology has democratized building and creating for everyone with persistence and self-belief.
Your 1st idea may not work, your 10th venture may fail. What you learnt along the away,
Will help you towards the 11th venture that would become a blockbuster success.

Let the spice flow, go on longer walks, take on bigger adventures. YOLO
