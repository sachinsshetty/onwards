Fight or flight 

Stop running away,  clamp away the flight repsone during every problem.
You need to fight for yourself and avoid being blindsided for laziness of work.
Become steady in your action, dont become distracted with shiny things. 
You have to take ownership for every action you take and dont take, cant keep blaming the world and misfortune for every avoidable.
Your life has become a pathetic example on how to make things bad from normal things. 
Dont assume you will get away by hiding, 
a bad penny will always bite back.

Think, hard and slow.
Where you want live to take you? 
What necessary actions you have to execute to proceed in the directions, there is no magic pill out of this misery. You have to put in the hard back breaking work.
Wake up now, please.
