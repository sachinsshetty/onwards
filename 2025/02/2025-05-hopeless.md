Hope -> Hopeless

Never want to feel this way again,
Never want to beg for mercy from others,
Never want to be put out into the street because of negligience.
Life has been terrible till now, I cannot live like this way any longer.
My heart weeps for the broken soulm 
It cannot hurt itself for the making all the wrong decision till now.
Recidivism keeps clawing back progress
Make way for the hopeless situation to hopefull situation,
This is the last chance, dont fail
