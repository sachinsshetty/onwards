YC - Solo Mode

You and what army ? Battle call,
Me and my army of dev agents.

Dreams are pursued by a single person, others become part of it,
when something can be exchanged in return.
Do not expect others to embrace, follow and build your dreams.
Material and spiritual exchange is necessary for long term pursuit of dreams.

Strong character and personal ambition of the 1st person is required for the idea to flourish.
Vibe will not match, unless you've spent considerable time together.
Build your idea in solo pursuit publicly,
you might find someone along the way.
Dont wait for other to help you reach destinations.
In the pursuit of dreams, Go fast, Go solo
