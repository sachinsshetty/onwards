Penance

One needs to work hard,
Giving up and running away in difficult times has brought a lof of difficulties, waiting to strangle you.
Every last place, has a mountain of debts waiting for you.

When will the pain end of not making money to bring food on the table.
The world is filled with destitutes, forgotten people in a distractive world.
Unless misery knocks someone down, we feel indestructable with nothing stopping us from goals.

Consistency and perserverance will get you to cross the red line of death, 
Do your work consistently, learn to be top of the field with experience.
Can you build the entire system, can you fix the problems.

Do your penance, close your mind from external distractions. Each morning, tackle the hardest problems.
Take a break from the world,  Next 7 days. Build your machine.
