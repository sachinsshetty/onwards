Agents

Starting with AI agents is useless, 
Unless you have a product that can make money from the use of agents.

Think of a problem to solve, 
Become the first agents yourself solving it with LLM and copilot. 

Observe your own interaction, Next make the agents replicate you.

MATRIX

You and what army?

Me and my agents running haphazard in a constrained GPU.
Learning to maximize their outcomes.

Energy and compute efficiency always comes from poverty (GPU)

Dont stumble by resting when you are ahead,
Cross the finish line and run headstrong into the next adventure. 

We are now in speed run with Civilization. 
Can you use the tools fast ? 
Can you build usable product, make it work, make it fast, dont stop and hold back
