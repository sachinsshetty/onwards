Patience 

Make progress each day,
It need not be significant amount and break prior records

We are now in the journey of compounded interest, we are taking a long term bet.
As a force multiplier, we are updating our direction constantly and building our pace forward. 

Use the power of nature to propel oneself forward,  like the seasons grow each spring and summer. Take rest in autumn and winter.
Sprint when the road is clear, 
Walk and crawl when its new territory. 

Destroy ego of self, work ethically with others and help with your skills.

Let saraswati guide you, study i depth and make knowledge to useful by solving problems.
