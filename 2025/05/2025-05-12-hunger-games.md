Hunger Games

You can never stop running towards the goal, the next milestone, the next paycheck.
Any slip-up and distraction along the way will lead to repeated failure.
Its do or die, there is not way to survive the hunger games.
Being the absolute best with daily hard work and execution of primary tasks can make a little dent in the universe.
Maintain the discipline in work, body and mind. 
We have thousands of miles to cross the chasm of failure.
Be aware of the pitfalls, avoid repeating past mistakes.
Speed run your experiments. Beat hunger or disapper into the oblivion.
