Hunger Games 

Standing outside a restaurant, trying to come with situations to get a free meal.
Hunger is painful, cant think of doing anything.
Tears have run dry, there is no hope in sight. 

Homeless since a few days,  not paying rent for the last few months and being kicked out from the place and all your items in the sun.

Hoping that the friend, will call you to cook and eat. One meal for the week , you survive based on the grace of friends.

You eat something once a day and then do nothing. Since there is nothing to do which can earn money.
You spiral into debt, depression, Waiting and thinking to jump off from a window to escape the pain
