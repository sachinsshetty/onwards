Winners Practice,  Not Sacrifice 

Winners call it practice 

When you are building anything new, consider the daily effort as practice.
Dont call it sacrifice and work.
You have been given an opportunity to do the feats of gods.
Dont consider the failures/loss as blockers, 
Consider it as another experiment and change the inputs/parameters to next experiment


Everyday is a gift, 
Be grateful to the good health of self and family. Monetary wealth can be recovered with hard work. Never lose your health and character for short-term goals.
