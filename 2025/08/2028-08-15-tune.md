tune

Bend the will to the tune of your own music 
Build the world in your vision
We get to live only this life, do your work and shine like a diamond. 
You are made of stardust.

Focus is the currency that keeps the world running. 
You should try a hundred different things, but choose a mission for your existence.
Build everything according to the mission.
Nothing else matters

Do it for the creation,
Not for the adulation and fame. Make it work, find a way every day.
It took 25 years for SpaceX, have a strong vision for your future.

As the new day begins,
remember that you are always loved by family and friends every day.
Birthday is a day of celebration with others. the next year is a celebration of every new day.

3 month Focus

Stop optimising for a local event

Stop creating plans based on a chance outcome

Imagine nothing will work and you receive complete rejections

How will dwani flourish, inspite of difficulties.

Make it Plan A, how to build dwani with zero external grants and investments.
