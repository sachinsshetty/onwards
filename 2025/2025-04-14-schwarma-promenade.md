schwarma / promenade 



Eating the schwarma on the Rhine promenade,Bonn is a blissful feeling.

You watch by the container ships moving slowly on the water, each following their assigned lanes.


Families let out the kids on the waterfront walking  along with the strollers.
Cyclists now have a wide path, with the city reclaiming the space from the automobile road. 

You come here, everytime to clear the cobwebs in your brain after a tiring day or when your stuck and dont know how to proceed.

The distant mountains and drachnfels ruins give a perspectives on the time horizon and the longevity of the world.  You keep doing your work, it will matter only to you,  so do the best. 

You live only once,  every work should be treated with respect . Appreciate the simple wonders of the world. Stay hungry,  stay curious
