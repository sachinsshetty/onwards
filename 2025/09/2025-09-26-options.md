No options 

until you make things till it breaks you down, 
You have not fought hard enough.

Fight the chaos and bring in the path with ideas made into produxts.

Discipline will save you and continue the momentum. 

Fight every obstacle, you will prevail , failure will be secondary when your done. 

Keep fighting,  never give up.

We dont have another option.
