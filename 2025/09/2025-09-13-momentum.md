Momentum for dwani 


Build it step by step,
No need of exorbitant finances, 
Just make it useful. 
Talk to users,  see where they are failing.

If i cant get servers, then i will work on workstations
We will work with whatever is available,  there is no roadblock.  Like the river,  we will find a way. 
Or break the barriers one knock at a time.

Nothing is insurmountable,  many have built empires by starting with worse initial conditions. 

Just have to fight it everyday,  
Move the needle,  keep the momentum strong.
We cant give up now.
