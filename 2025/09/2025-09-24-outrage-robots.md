Outrage Economy

Work on the hardest problems, solve previously unexplored problems

Quit all the outrage economy, getting you hooked to rage/disgust and earning money

Build the robots and aircrafts, that you once dreamed as a child.

Let your mind rest, let it connect the dots. 

Choose to do hard things, because its the only thing pushing the envelope of the world

Dont wait for someone else to fix the problem for you, go do it yourself.

Make it count.
