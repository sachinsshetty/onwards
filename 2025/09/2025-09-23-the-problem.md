The Problem

The problem is the problem to solve.
Not having GPU/compure is not a reason for the project unable to generate revenue.

Your trying to do many things at once and not doing anything properly. There is no deadline or goal to reach, its whatever is fancy .

Running every morning is not dependent on having track-shoes, its about the act of waking up early and running each day to be healthy. 
Its never the shoes that makes the runner, but the destination and progress they make every day.

Solve an acutal problem today, dont just keep shouting  at the sky and hoping to hit an arbitrary jackpot.
Startup's/growth is not a lottery based on luck. 
Its about the focus and being the best in the field.

putting the blinders and adding making what changes one can.

Its the survival of fittest, 
you have chosen to fight,
dont beg for mercy and seek fairness.

fight , skill up .

Pitching a devTool to non-technical Jury is mind-breaking.

the beatings will continue, until morale improves.

fumbled pitch for accelerator.

YOLO, gotta keep the dream alive

We are all in this together, 
have to walk each step up to the summit.
