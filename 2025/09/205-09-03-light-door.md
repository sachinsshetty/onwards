Light at the Door

darkest night, shows the brightest stars.

a door closed, making the area dark.

then a light a was lurking in a nearby door, 

keep fighting.

rage against the dying of the light.

find the way, like a river 

---


survive

Survive at all costs, 

Dont despair, 

Fight, Fight,  Fight. 

Fight against the dying of the light.
