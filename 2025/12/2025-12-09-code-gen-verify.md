Code Gen - Verify > Mantra

Unverified and lossy code will leak into critical systems, destabilizing infrastructure in unknown ways.


Will experiment with context size of LLM sessions from Cursor/Windsurf/Claude Code/Codex to make clean code .


Idea is similar to compaction, can we export the existing sessions and restart afresh with delta info. Make the sessions exportable to Markdown to be input into any systems.
