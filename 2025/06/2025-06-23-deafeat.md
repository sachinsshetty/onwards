Defeat

All defeats are temporary 
Only death is final and permanent 

Each night we die and are reborn the next day

Our current situation can change immediately for  Good or Worse.

Live now,  do what you need to grow

Dream higher,  dream bigger goals.

The harder your goal is, the greater your strength your becomes as your pursue it every breath.

You get to live only once,  become the best version of yourself
