Battered,  Tired,  Weak 


I will not break, 
I cannot be broken. 
What doesn't kill you,  Makes you stronger. 

Take the rein of your future,  do not leave anything to chance.

Push through obstacles,  demand higher standard from yourself.

Become strong,  learn with focus and build strength in your body.

You dont have to burn the midnight oil,  if you can get things done with concentration the first.
Get it right the first instance..
