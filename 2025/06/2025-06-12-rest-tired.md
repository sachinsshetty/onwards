Rest, Tired

When you are tired, 
Do not quit your vision and work.
Take rest and recover, its ok to slow progress for a day and take a break. 

When you face rejections, take the feedback and improve the approach for the next attempt.
It means that your product is not mature and still has room for improvement. 

Make daily progress and update your system to take direct feedback faster and change. 
Rate of change should keep increasing and should never stop. 


Quitting is permanent,  pause and rest for the next round. 

Each day is a gift and opportunity to do your best work. 
Make something that you feel happy to build and enjoy doing.
