Self Belief

Its the new age of solo developer led founders/entrepreneurs building solutions for  every-day problems
with assistance from LLMs/GenAI. 
Like 3 person team from read.cv who built a creator platform and were acqui-hired to build/work on a larger platform.

You no longer require a 10 person team anymore, from 2-pizza team to 1-pizza-team its now mini-pizza team.
You can create your dreams into reality with disciplined work. 
Build it in public, find more user to work for the project as a community.
