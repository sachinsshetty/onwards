Uttarayana

time to shift gears again and follow the light.

a months of rest/leisure/doomscrolling is over.

the world keeps flying away, while you wait and sleep.

each day make your progress, you cannot connect the dots today.

Only when you look back, you can see what you hit and miss.

Everyday is constant, you have to make something out of it.

Get things done today, tomorrow.

Put your next step forward, move, move, move
