Lottery

Do not leave anything to chance or good luck
If you dont actively try to solve problems, they will keep on piling infinitely
Nobocy can outrun death and taxes

Be grateful to the opportunity that have been presented to you,
Keep working to make new opportunities

Do not rely on lottery and sympathy of others to make your life easy.
You will run out of luck and fuel to make suitable progress

Actively plan your life, do not jump to conculsions and decisions that lead to misfortune.
Become aware of the world, spend time thinking and doing thins each day.

Nothing is easy, keep solving problems actively
Better to build a fortune when you have strength today, rather than crawling in the deep when you are old.

You can always pick yourself up, life gives opportunites if you keep standing up.
Nothing is lost forever, only you can do it.
