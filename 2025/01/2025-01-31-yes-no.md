Fight or flight. 

There is no way out in fighting your battles.
Either do it now, when you have strength and ability to take a hit and get back up with persistence. 
Else you run away and later when it comes knowing, you will never able to recover

Yes and No

When you choose to do something, you say Yes to the particular order of living and you say No to everything else. 

Do you say yes to mediocrity, wallowing in pity when things don't materialize positively on your behalf

Cutting weights

Remove friction in your environment. 
What is necessary to solve problems keep it, everything else goes down the trash container. 
Distraction and keepsake bring lots of weight and burden in the long run.
Within no time, you realize that you've been slowed down by unseen things hidden by chaos.

Become chaos to chaos itself,  systematically break down everything. Take zero prisoners, only the best should survive.
