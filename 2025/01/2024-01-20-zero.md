Zero

Hit zero again, wallet has become unusable with no cash to spend.
Debts have spiralled with job-loss.
Mind has gone numb for a month from breakdown of hope.
Gambling time away is 100% invitation for disaster and misery.

It is ok to pick-up the pieces again, avoid repeating mistakes and delay everyday tasks.
Dont get overwhelmed experimenting a 100 different things.
Manage your focus and energy, You have hit rock-bottom,
everything that comes next is a bonus and way to live better.
Never skip on doing hard work with dedication and earnest effort.

You have to try and do things each minute to do great things.

Try, try, try.
