Doors

A door opens and another door closes.

Hate being evicted again ,
This laziness has caused misery again and again.

What do we need to win bravely,
How can we make better choices and not be at the mercy of another entity. 

Time does not wait for anyone, 
It derials every single obstacle in its path, 
It is an unstoppable force that cannot be tamed.

We have to become strong and fit for the future and against better outcome.
