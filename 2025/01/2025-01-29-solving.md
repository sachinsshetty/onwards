Like the reasoning/thinking from LLM's build your own dataset and evaluate the results.

Solve for 1, next scale it for 100 and 1000.
Build a usable product, either Consumer product or a Tech product.

GitHub projects should be buildable with simple steps or containerized like with Docker. 

Will you able to run the project yourself after a few weeks/months. 

Write the code to solve a problem, 
toy examples are a good start.

Also solve problems related to domains of your target company, it is easier to discuss merits and demerits during the interview.

Experiment continuously, like playing Mario infinitely.
