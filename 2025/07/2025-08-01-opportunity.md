Opportunity of Now

Make the best of your current opportunities, 

Dont waste time wishing for a better hand.

Most times we dont do what we can for today, 
Waiting that things would somehow get fixed without putting the effort for it. 

You have to climb the stairs , each step at a time to reach the next stage. 
There are no elevators on the mountain,
For every person the path is different. 
Nobody can carry you to the top, nobody can take your luggage. 

Wearing someone's merchandised shirt will only help you get identified.  You still have to do the work, nothing comes free. Everything needs to be repaid.

Forget the external world, do what you can today.
