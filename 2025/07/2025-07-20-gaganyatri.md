Gaganyatri 

When you are tired ,you rest,
When you are sleepy  you sleep,
When you are hungry,  you eat.

Dont let a bad day, make it a bad life.
There will be ups and downs. 
Stay strong and do what you need to do.

There are many days, when you wish it was not so tough. 
When you understand,  that it will be harder each day.
There is no plan B. 
There was never a plan B.
This is how it how you become Gaganyatri .

Each day, you take it as important day.
You dont step back from your everyday work. 
You do what is necessary,  you experiment with new activities in the weekend. 
Nothing is left to chance, everything has to be executed to the exact detail. 

We will occupy Mars, we will do justice to the life given to us and opportunities that can be made each moment. 
Choose to the do work worthy of legends.
