HF - GPU community grant

Project Website - Dhwani is a self-hosted GenAI platform designed to provide voice mode interaction for Kannada and other Indian languages.

Research goal

    Measure and improve the Time to First Token Generation (TTFTG) for model architectures in ASR, Translation, and TTS systems.
    Develop and enhance a Kannada voice model that meets industry standards set by OpenAI, Google, ElevenLabs, xAI

We have integrated ASR,LLM,TTS models from https://huggingface.co/ai4bharat .
Initially standalone systems were also created, but they incurred multiple gpu costs.
We want setup the full requirement in a single gpu.
