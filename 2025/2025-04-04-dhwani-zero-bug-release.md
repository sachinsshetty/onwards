Dhwani - Zero Bug Release 



Do not release a new version to others without fixing all existing bugs.

Make internal releases, but dont publicly announce the new feaures.

The next release will make or break the Project.

There won't be third try for the initial users,
Make sure that you have released a working and polished product. 


User's should fall in love with the product. 
That should be the main target of release. 

It should just work, no ifs and buts.
