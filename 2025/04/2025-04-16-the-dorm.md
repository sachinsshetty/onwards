The Dorm

After 7 years of misery, we are now going back to live in a dorm
How badly we have fallen, one wrong decision and negligence in ambition 
and the workd came crashing down
Work on your strengths and not fixate your passions.
The problems of the world can be solved by choosing a single problem
Dont lose out by promising many things, Just do one thing reasonable good.
