Time

We get one shot at life, our time is limited in this world.

The time with family and friends and loved ones is even shorter.

Live a life of contentment and curiosity.

A content life will lead to peace and long term affinity to the world,

curioisity will help you unravel the mysteries of life, without losing the forest for the trees.

There is a balance in chaos and chaos in balance.

Each of us has a different path, but a path nonetheless.

The path can be chose for us at the beginning, in time we get/have to make opportunities to choose our own path.

Failures are another name for experiments, the more you try, experiment, fail and learn.

The better the next venture is built from previous learning, 

Live life, make your time on Earth, fantastic.
