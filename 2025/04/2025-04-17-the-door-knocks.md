The Door Knocks

There is a way forward,
You have to keep putting the next step forward, 
We cannot stop working and rest on past laurelss
Do your best in your limited time on earth

We are mortals, given the powers of God with a single click
Make the world better, Build what you would use.
Never stop learning.

Keep knocking on the doors,
Show up and do the work, Do not just talk about what you will do.
Do it now, Do it everyday, Do it for 6 months.
One door will open and that will open more opportunities.

Keep building, keep breaking
