Done  - Goals


Keep getting things done

There is no mountain to climb in 1 day,  
If you make progress everyday in the journey. 

Go fast when you have sight of the next milestone, 
Go slow when you have to traverse the path in a uncertain territory. 

There is no race , no Milestone and competition to beat.  
Indian has 1.5 Billion people, 
Reaching 100 daily users and serving them real time information and real time latency is the next goal .

Ignore all revenue metrics to hit,  first solve the problem without mistakes. 

We are in this for 5 year horizon,
We will keep it simple, stay lean, stay curious and experiment every day.

The music should keep playing.
