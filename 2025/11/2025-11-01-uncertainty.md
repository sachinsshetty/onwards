Uncertainty

Work on removing uncertain goals into fixed paths
We cannot shoot at the sky and hope to hit any stars
Settle down and think, what is needed to get things working again.

Nobody has all the answers, you have to go through everything.
Do a speed run, dont wait.
Reach out to others, show what you can.
