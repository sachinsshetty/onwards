Think

You are alive,  Be grateful
Think hard and long and solve the problems
Let your mind calm down and choose what it want
Keep away from digital media
Bring back self control
Schedule time for all activities,
Proceed with planned steps,
Think everythin through,
Every problem has a solution,
Anticipate and plan for everything.
Do not let anything for chance
Count and oberserve your minutes
Think
