The Pursuit of Excellence

Think what you want from the world
Think how you can spend today
Think what is important
Think who needs to be taken care of
Think the consequences of not doing work
Think the future that awaits
Focus today, Focus now
You can make each day and make things better
Whatever the current circumstance, you can overcome the difficulty with work
Dont stop pusing ahead, keep doing the priority work
Dont look back, Dont let the past failures define you
