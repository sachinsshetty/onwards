Figure - Out

We will figure it out.

Nothing is truly lost

Even the worst storms will pass

Hold strong, absorb the pain

You can and will overcome the current discomfort

Keep moving each day, it would not be easy but it wont be impossible

Dream big, live within your means
Target excellence in every work done.

Breathe, Love, Live

Limbo

Stay or Leave

Need to find a reason to take the final decision,
Cannot survive only on vibes.
