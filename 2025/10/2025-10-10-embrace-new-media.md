stop waiting for opportunity, pursue things fast and move fast.

Use your brain, dont be distracted

Do something first and then tell when its complete.  Make it the best avaialable solution using whatever tool is available. Dont cut any corners.

Dont make half promises and half done work. Go and get it.
