3 day life 

Last few months, i have been living in 3 day stretches. 

Without any savings of my own, have been asking for support from friend's.  Taken small amounts from all known people,  have become the miser and the beggar .

Affording one meal a day,  has become difficult.  Going to places which have snacks and drinks to beat away the hunger.

Its been a very difficult time, repeating almost 4 times in the last 8 years.  
Life should be not lived this way,  
I will become better and stronger .
