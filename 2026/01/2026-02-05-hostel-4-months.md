Hostel - 4 months 

Time has been flying since November 2026

Living in a hostel with 2/3 days stay guaranteed has taken a toll on life.

Just managing to stay alive each day.
The most difficult time again repeated 5th time in 8 years .

Need to inculcate extreme discipline to get out of this rut, no matter the external condition, i cannot and will not break.

We will fight it and figure it out.

Take only one problem and take it to the finish.

Reduce complexity in everyday life, bring back regular schedule with toughest problems tried the first time.
