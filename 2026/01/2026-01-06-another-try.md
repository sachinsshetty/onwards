Misery - Thief

You have good health and a future without disability. 

Dont lose hope due to current misfortune. 

Your misery increases only when you compare yourself against others.

Stop and restart again. 
As long as you have breathe in your lungs and water to drink, you can still live a good life.

Despair - Hope lost 
.When despair tugs at you,
Everything crashes down and makes you wish that life would end.

What a life to live, that no hope exists during the day.

Each day, passes by and one wonders, why am i alive.

 another hope

You just stay alive .

You keep moving ahead in life, taking the hits as they come and get going ahead.

Don't complicate life, by thinking too far into the future.  Like the cycle of life- you will find joy and sorrow at every step. 
It's only a bad day, week or month.  
Its not a bad life.

See how far you have come in life and plan for the future.  Its ok to fail many times, dont give up on life so easily.
