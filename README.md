Hey, I am Sachin from Germany. 

I am building https://dwani.ai - Voice assistant for German/Indian languages. 

Its the Open Source alternative for Alexa/Siri.  

Recently we got into Nvidia Inception program and got access to  GPU credits to accelerate building the prototype into product. 

dwani.ai is a self-hosted solution, you can customise it for your native language and run your personal Jarvis at Home.
