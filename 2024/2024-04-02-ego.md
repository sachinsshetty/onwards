Ego - Adventure 

Your ego wants to you continue the current path.  It avoids any kind of risk taking adventure. 
To maintain a sense of status,  we dont take risks. We do not want to be labelled as a failure.

Build out your idea into a real item , start with a plan. Make time for it over the weekend.
This life should not become a unused movie reel,  where nothing significant was captured due to lack of urgency and application. 

Everything you imagine is possible,  choose one path and work towards it. Atleast utilize 3 months of your idle time into creating the project.  The time spent for entertainment should be converted into hobby project. 

Don't let your ego put you into a falsr sense of security. Equip yourself with skills to last 8 decades, where each decade you have a competition advantage over your peers.  Learn every year,  build up skills and expertise to be at the leading edge.  Don't fall behind, keep the sail stay,  don't rock the bottom every time.  Choose the currents wisely
