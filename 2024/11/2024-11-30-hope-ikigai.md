Hope - Ikigai

Whenever i feek that life has become too difficult & I struggle to get things done.
A blind person comes across, trying to walk across the footpath,
with their stick tapping before each step to avoid pitfalls.
Today i saw another blind person, buying groceries independently.

We are given all the gifts, we forget to realise it and fall into misery.
Life is difficult, it like the different seasons. Warm, cold, breezy, rain. 

Be hopeful for the gift of today, dont always keep thinking of tomorrow.
Do what you should do today. Bring out your best.
