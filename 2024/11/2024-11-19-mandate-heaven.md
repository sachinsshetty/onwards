Mandate of Heaven


We are stuck in misery and we blame the gods.

Even now, you can change the course of your destiny. 

Just work for 4 hours with complete focus on the task with highest returns.

Nothing will stop you from achieving your goals.
Keep the goals short and gather new goals as you surpass them. 

You may have fumbled in life before ,
You may have never got the chance to pursue ,
You can still bring change in your life,  age is just a number. 
The bricklayer will build the fortress and castle by adding a wall each day,  
Keep adding your foundation each day ,
There has never been a great time to start anew again. 

Create your own leverage, as you build better tools your network will arrive.
Dont ask for donation/sponsorship before you even made a month/year of progress.

The consistent will reap the benefits of compounding knowledge.
