Nightmare

The first nightmare is losing job without notice. It has become a living nightmare due to being unemployed since 2 weeks.
1 week of forced unemployment and 1 week of actual joblessness.
The second nightmare is running out of money for food and housing.
Being neck deep in credit card/loans was fine with serviceable income,
praying that unemployment benefits are available and i can breathe for a month atleast.
Need a safe spot to work harder again.
