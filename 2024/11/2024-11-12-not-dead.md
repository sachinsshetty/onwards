Not Dead

What does not kill you, makes you stronger and alive.
You are not defined by your work,
Not defined by your employees,
End of Job is not end of life,
A closed door means that you need a different door.
There will doors that will be open, keep looking for the next door.
Everything will work out, you keep learning.

She kept putting the next step forward, knowing that the helper
will not always be present and she has to become independent.
