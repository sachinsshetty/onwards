Life and Death

Sometimes we are overwhelmed by the problems we face in daily life.
Sometimes we feel that life should just end, so that misery ends with it.
See the difficult stages of life as practice session for a better life or life attuned to miseries and still hopeful.
Take life's multiple blows, dust it off your shoulder and pick up your work.
Death brings gloom to the world of the loved one's who have lost the departed one.

Take your time to grieve, its a pain that cannot be solved.
We need to process the feeling individually.
Let time heal you, this world will keep moving ahead, asking us to look forward again.
