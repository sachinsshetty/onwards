One Thought Experiment

For a minute, hour, day, Try to keep a single thought in focus.
Choose career, love, future, problems, past, faith or anything that you want to progress.

Only think and focus on the single thought, notwedown each strand of thought and thinking pattern.
Hold this thought experiment each day to clarify the chaos in your mind.

You've had enough outside influence, now listen to your own thought.
See how it unfolds, it may lead to nothing or everything.

Keep the thought strong, keep holding on to it.

Your progress in life has not proceeded since you did not think ahead for long duration.
