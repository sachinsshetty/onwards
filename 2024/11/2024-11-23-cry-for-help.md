Cry for Help

Did we misunderstand the cry for help, as another request for support.
Did we assume wrong that they would manage everything and that support was not necessary.
Did the pain become too much for her to survive alone.
Regrets now keep piling, based on the bad outcome.
It is a witch hunt, when you can find a 100 reasons that we could have avoided it.
Excuses become rampant, stop looking at the past after a certain time.
The grief is too much for you to endure and suffer alone.
Help all those who come before you, 
You need help people to have hope to be helped again in times of difficulty.
My mind has gone blank,
I cannot process the loss, It terrifies me to think how you and other are suffering.
Dont take all the blame, process the loss at your own time.
We will come overcome the future obstacles together.
I am sorry, i was not avaialble to help in time in need.
This keep keeps increasing, I will become stronger and face any obstacles that come in the way.
It will and need to fight hard to get out of this misery
