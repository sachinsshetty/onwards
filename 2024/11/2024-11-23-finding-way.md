Finding a way

You cannot watch TV,  scroll socail media endlessly
without doing deep work to find a way out of misery.

You cannot ignore reality, it will find you and knock you down.
Dont run away from your problems, solve it step by step.
Everyone can have a better future, believe in the future.

Build your systems, make your schedule as disciplined as a trainee for Olympics.

Have the mindset of an Olympic winner, Reaching the finishing goal should be 
the only vision. Nothing else should matter
