Disenchantment 

Seems like a large rock is lifted from my shoulders. 
I was stuck to a thankless job without support and collaboration to build new things. 
Only the role was glamorous and i had nothing to build with.

The work on open source has helped to get confidence to work on new frontiers and build great things. 
I am no longer bound to the location,  i can spread my wings around and rise again like a phoenix.

Dont apologize and be sorry for doing your job.
