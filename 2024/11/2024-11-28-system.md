System

Excellence is not luck, but a series of focussed efforts into an unbreakable habit.
Your future and current circumstances will be/is determined by the systems you follow.

Are you learning every day ?
Do you excercise each day ? You need a strong body to outwit and outwork your competition.
You need to do better than what you did yesterday.
Do you avoid social media & doomscrolling for unhealthy extended hours?

Read in depth, understand the foundation with clear mind. Half knowledge is dangerous.

Your system will define your future ?
Fix it today, Fix it now, for a better future.
