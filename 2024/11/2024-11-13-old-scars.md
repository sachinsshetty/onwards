Old Scars

Any slip-up and ghosts of old scars, start to pounce with vengeance.
You lost everything to lethargy and incompetence.
Now you need to win everyday with hardwork and dedication.
You cannt allow even a single day to be lost. 
You have to to do the work now, others have doing it for all their life.
You only see thier final success, but you have not seen their struggles.
Learning by executing and failing is part of the struggle.
Embrace that work is your key to a calm mind and non-shaky future.
Why do you want to live in mediocrity ?
Put your hand out for reaching the stars.
