Intensity

You need to pick up pace to build your dreams and finish milestones.
Your schedule and task-completions should always be prioritised and completed with total focus.
Set your own pace, when you are the lone-wolf, you need to hunt ferociously,
else you will die a slow death due to hunger and loss of basic skills with lethargy and incompetence.

Go fast, shine brilliantly like a rocket, 
Do not go gentle, become a strict task master for your ventures.
Breathe fire into your goals, you should find your path and keep sprinting.
This is not the time for jay-walking, build exceptional products using all your skills and persistence.
