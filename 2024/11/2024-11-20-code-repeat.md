Code, Sleep, Repeat

Focus on the idea and code it fast with any help.
Ship the simple features each day.
The app progress can be done page by page each day.
Redo the broken parts, removed unused paths as and when you see it.

Use Code-assistants to refactor the system after every 3 days of work.
Its better to have the system reviewed by a perr.

Sleep properly and get good amount of rest by recharging your batteries.
Touch some grass, go for walks to breathe fresh air. 
Dont become stuck in your work desk and screen.

We are doing an Ironman/Triathlon competition with Sanjeevini app.
The goal is to finish comforatably without disasters.
Its about training each day well to growing stamina.

It can be done, It has been done. Do it.
