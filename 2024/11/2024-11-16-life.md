Life

Till you have breathed your last air, you can turn your life around.
Put your 10 years of work from today. 

Learn the skills not learnt, become a better human being.

Dont let the struggles define your entire life,
It's just a difficult phase, work to improve it and change the phase.
Nothing is permanent, build your life again.

You can do it,  others have done it before and changed their lives around.
