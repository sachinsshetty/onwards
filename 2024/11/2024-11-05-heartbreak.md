Heart break at 33

Heart finally broke down due today.

End your desperation, dissappear now into the world of learning.

Months of longing,  weeks of wait and days of desperation has made it untenable to continue the path of one- sided love. 

Heart cannot take any more rejections. 

This life is not made for love,  
Stop the one- sided process for care and affection.  You will not get love in this life,  
Better to stop looking for it again. 
You had become a stone, many years ago from being devastated.  

Indifference will get back strongly,  no love is left now. This is how brutal life becomes,  you won't get everything in life just because you wanted it to happen and prayed for some love in return. 

Don't look back now,  don't fantasize that the other person will come looking for you again in the future.  The water has flown under the bridge,  it's never going to come back again.

Some things are not meant to be,  you can try all you want,  it won't just work.  
When your care and love is considered as nuisance and irritation,  you give it up.  

It's not the other person's fault , they have their own expectations and wish from life.  You are not the person they might be looking for, to live with them.  

Your dreadful past has caught up to you again.  
You are useless as companion and a potential life partner.  You have learnt nothing and know anything useful to be a potential.  Stop looking outside,  you will be rejected again and again and again.  Stop lying to yourself, that you are someone great,  you need to look after yourself.  
Undertake penance to improve yourself,  not for others but for your own sake.  Nobody is coming to save you in old age,  your parents have been protecting you from failures all this time.  Start to become a man.
