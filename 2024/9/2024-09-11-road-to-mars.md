Road to Mars 

You have to become better than the best
You have to out think them by learning and practicing each day
You have to out work your peers with extreme dedication,  patience and long term trust.

Don't hold out any punches now.
You know what you want to accomplish
Nobody will help you and do it for you
Everyone have their own dreams to pursue 
You have to pursue your own dreams 

There will be a lot of setbacks, a lot of things and people needing your attention. Do what is necessary,  but don't be detailed with the actual work to be done.

Things at the top priority, should never be at the mercy of distraction.

We want to go to Mars. We are learning to get things done. We will keep pushing the envelope every single day.
No time to waste,  equal parts work,  equal parts rest and equal parts recovery .
Lets go, Polaris Dawn has begun the next phase. 
We will build on top of it.
