Space Walk - Sep 12 - 2024

Like a dream becoming a reality. Watching a Human in space,
Outside the space craft was mind-numbing and exhilarating.
The eyes would not believe what was being seen in Real-time from 
the camera on the space-suit at the helmet.
The vast expanse of Earth with the backdrop of the empty vaccum of space
was and is a sight to behold as the jewel of existence.
We want to return to this stage and get to do a lot of more activities with the SpaceX suit.
