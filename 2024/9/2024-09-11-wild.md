Taming the wild

Taming the wild streaks of Man, 
Will lead to a journey of great bounty without being derailed by distraction.
You need to have strong purpose. 
What makes you feel alive,  each morning that you wake up.

Every night, you go to sleep with satisfaction of the effort made. 
You acutely know what you are going to do the next day, week and month.

No matter what is the consequence of Life current status, never give up on your purpose. Let it lead you in times of darkness,  madness around you, turmoil around  you, setbacks in your own life. You have to keep going forward in the path that you have chosen.
