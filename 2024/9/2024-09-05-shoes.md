Not the shoes

When you run every day
You will find sponsorrs after a few years of excellence 
You cannot start running only after getting sponsors 
With such a constraint,  no task will be attempted and no discoveries will be done.

You will not be paid to read and learn at your leisure. You are expected to participate curiously and build products/knowledge for the salary paid.

If you want to go to mars, 
You will have to be fit like an astronaut,
You have to be smart like a scientist, 
You have to quick like a pilot. 
Nobody will pay you or spend their precious time to accommodate your wishes. 

You have to embrace and become the roles at your own cost. You dont have time to spend.
Time is being evaporated at an extreme rate. 
Become laser focussed,  start running each day to be fit like an Astronaut,  start reading and experimenting with space tech to become smart as a scientist,  start completing tasks on time, priorities high value goals and be aware of your environment like a pilot. 
You have to get your life back in order ,
Discipline will bring good habits,.expel all the inadequacy and mistakes that have seeped into your conscience. 

Dream high, work harder. We get to do this after all the skirmish being thrown around.
Get it done. NOW 
Get going. NOW 

Its not about the shoes, its about you running fast towards the milestone. Be a competition monster
