We are not destined to die on Earth.
Like the ocean explorers of the 16-19th century, we will explore our solar system this century. 
21st century will blossom with private and commercial space travel.

like Interstellar movie theme - 

Old age should burn and rave at close of day;
Rage, rage against the dying of the light.

Though wise men at their end know dark is right,
Because their words had forked no lightning they
Do not go gentle into that good night.


We will rage against the dying of human consciousness on earth. We will seed the universe with new life and prosperity.
