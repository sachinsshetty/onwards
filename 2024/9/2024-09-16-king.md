king and Philosopher 

Become the king first
Then upgrade to Philosopher .

Its a terrific world outside , where it is the survival of the fittest. 

Nothing will be handed down to you. 
You have to fight everyday to achieve your dreams and reach new milestone. 

Stop postponing your dreams to the next decade. 
You can do a lot in a day if you focus right. 
A week will get you alpha prototype, 
2 weeks will get you marketing and sales.
3 weeks will get you beta prototype with production grade set-up. 
4 weeks will get you First recurring customer.

Build it today, stop with idle procrastination and distracted dopamine hits with social media.

Do the king's work, get the king's bounty. 
Everything has a price,  you have to pay for it.

Mars is not for faint hearted,  only the extreme adventure junkies and explorers can survive Day 1.
