Outsized Dreams

Your dreams should be so large,
the tasks to be executed daily, to be in constant touch with the dreams so great,
that the daily problems and life's machinations do not stand a choice.

People should identify you by your crazy dreams/goals that you talk about.
Dont be just talking, keep building the tools help to make the dreams a possibility.

Start with simple tasks and build into greater tools each day. 
Its ok if you started on your life's journey a bit later than you'd have liked it to be.
Its better late than never to start on your goals.
You do not want regrets to fill your world.

Always follow your heart, keep it strong with hopes and efforts.
Have outsized dreams, simple plans to pursue and strict daily execution.
There is no prize for half-hearted efforts, You give it all.
Your dreams and goals should consume your life.
