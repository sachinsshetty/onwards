Jumbo Jet - A380

All my flights have been booked near the wings.
I love to see the how the mechanism work when the plan accelerates during Take-off
and slows down during landing,

Its magic created by brilliant engineers. Most of the flights were the 737 and 787 Dreamliner.
They are large aircrafts carrying over 200+ people across the sky.

Now the A380 Jumbo Jet is a majestic beast, The size of A380 , surpassess/dwarves all the planes at the airport.
The wingspan cover's almost 15-20 rows of seat. One can't look across the window, 
if you are at the middle of the wing span.

This is what 21st centuru brings to the world. The JumboJet is a masterpiece created by human ingenuity.

The view from the camera from the rear tailwings, covers the whole aircraft. Its looks like gameplay video
from Aircraft simulator.

There is so much to learn, how they operate the flights. 
How the data is designed, how frequently its collected. 
Design your own aircraft, see how you can capture telemetry from the Aircraft.
