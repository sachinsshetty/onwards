End Goal

End goal is to survive on Mars. This is my life over-arching dream
and pursuit that has been engaged in the last few years.

"When i had something i really wanted to do, I went for it"
Prep your day to begin with this notion. You take on the hardest problems in the morning,
as the first task. Your daily tasks should always be directed towards Mars.
Do not distract yourself with sub-plots, do not take over unnecessary burden and
do not get involved in a long term drama.

We have a lot to learn and lot of experiments to be suitable for Mars.
A lifetime of practice to get a shot at the top Prize. 
Do not count how much effort you put, but observe how much effort was lost
when you were distracted by trivial issues.

Learn to build things well,
Learn to sell your skillset for a price.
Dont stay down, you now have to get up and try again.

Only when you build compelling product, someone will notice and utlitze it,
substandart work will be promptly rejected. Build fast and break things.

Observe and document every aspect of your life.Then update the plan based on your history.
We get to do this,
We should create the best electronics out of our life.

We want to walk with the Gods.
We will build machine's that will touch sky
