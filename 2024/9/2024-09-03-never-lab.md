Never see you at the lab

You say you want to be an Astronaut 

What do you do each  day,  that an Astronaut has to finish every day. 

I never see you in the gym,  building the strength necessary to withstand the acceleration of rocket launch. 

I never see you in the lab,  learning the necessary system . Building new process and creating new experiments . Every minute and every gram on space is important. Only the top notch can even make the top 10000 shortlist. You have to be among the top 10 in the world.

It is possible, maintain your schedule the destination will come. Dont just dream a difficult dream just to get a high.  

Go to the gym now
Go to the lab now 
Become competitive 
Dont wander aimlessly
Hit the targets, embrace your destiny
