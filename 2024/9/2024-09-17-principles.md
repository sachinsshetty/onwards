First Principles

Build what will get you to Mars.

Build what works.

Dont create complex logic just to make it fancy.

Keep it as simple as possible. 

Reduce and avoid features which might be used once a month.

Instead improve/add feaute which is blocking people from their work.

Be intense in the short run and consistent in the long term.

Help yourself first,  build what you need. 

Identify your own requirements,  then prioritize the most important feature.  Go head long into solving the problem.  

A simple user interface is necessary for ease of use.  You can create a paywall and expect to get new users. 

Build the Mars window, build the space walker list. 
Give 2 days to any feature,  then move to the next problem.  Time box will get more stuff done than iterating a local minima.
