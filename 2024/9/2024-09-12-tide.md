Tide Change 

When mom broke down.
I realised that i was completely ignoring my family problems, 
I was hoping it would solve by itself.
All the delay was creating a snowball effect and leading to disaster.

I had to stop being selfish and assume my responsibility that I had forgone for a long time. 
Family pushed as far as possible on their strength, it eventually broke down. They tried not push any kind of responsibility on me and gave me a free hand to pursue my dreams.

Now that i have a stable foundation. I will take up my duties and be a support to family. Its not going to take over my life,  i only have to get better at scheduling.
