Family Resonsibility

You are now the foundation of the family.
Parents are frail now and need support in physical, emotional, future and financial security.
This is just another aspect of your life, which takes careful observation and planning.
Every person in the world fulfills this responsibility.
It's another skill that you have to learn and inculcate.
It's part of your life growth.



Plan to work

Everything needs a plan to work.
You cannot hope to acheive greatness, without adequate planning.
With a plan, you can prioritize what work can be done rather than be
affected by every new things that happens in your surrounding.
