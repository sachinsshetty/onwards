4 Year Roller coaster - Sep 19, 2020-24

Tomorrow, Sep 19, completes 4 years.
In 2020, it was a terrible mess. I had panic attacks on the flight. I still remember,  you reminding me that it will be fine. You diagnosed my problems,  assuring me that it's all normal effects under the circumstances. 

Last 4 years, have been a roller coaster ride. So many ups and downs.

I'm tired.  
Problems keep multiplying. 
Why can't I find solace.
