Storm

keep away from distractions. Push to the max, don't falter for distraction and pleasure. 
We live only once, become the best,no excuse,  no boasting.

First build it and then tell the world. Stay true to yourself,  Dont break the streak.
write code everyday.  
learn how space is tackled,by building modules each day.  
We had so much embarrassment at the hackathon,  we couldn't crack the top 5 places. 
No more taking foot of the pedal, we move fast and will make and break a million things.  We will not leave any stone unturned. Effort should not be lacking,
I will not be out-worked, out-thought and outnumbered ever again.
I will bring the Storm.
