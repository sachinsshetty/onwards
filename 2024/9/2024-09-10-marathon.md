Marathon

We are adding the sensors for the robots. 
All sensors now work individually. We connected the first text/language 
senors to other systems. Next step is to add voice commands to the central system.
Next steps is the voice controlled WebApp. 
We will next build the body for the robots. All the systems are locally available and redundant.
Making the systems highly reliable is an important goal. 
Each sensor is now having its own Intelligent software. 
Robots will have to become available at shops. They will have to become 
fixable by anyone with less training.
With recent advances in AI research, intelligence is available to anyone with just an Internet connection.
What will you do with it ?
