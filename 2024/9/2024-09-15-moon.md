Moon 

Ideas are million
Make it work with demo

Show how ur work,

Don't tell the world of your intentions 
Show them when it's done. 

Don't be content with the dopamine hit of your Impossible dreams, boasting of your chosen path. 

Its only you that has to cross the chasm.  
Nobody will cross with you. 
Build in public, let the world see version 3.
Don't broadcast your progress with a barely working alpha release. 


Show the magic of code. 
It does not matter where you're working. 
All that matters, what are you building. 
Everyone has enough time to build anything they wish.  It only matters if you want to build it now. 
There is no infinite time,  choose your destiny. 

Dear moon,  you are not going to get away. I will come soon,  everyday will push the boundaries and take strong focussed steps towards.

I will find, how far you are. Where you are and where you will be. The goal is set. Starting again on the path to Moon,  Mars and beyond.
