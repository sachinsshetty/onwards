Leaky Boat

You will eventually drown due to the leaky boat.

Every leak has to be handled immediately, pushing them later will cause  them to grow larger leading to larger problems. 

If you realise that something is causing a problem, address it at the earliest. Being able to predict problem's and fixing them before they become a monster is a skill to be learnt at every phase of life. 

Every action or inaction has consequences.
Leisure and procrastination will bring you downfall in the short term as job loss and long term as homelessness. 

Do your penance now. Pass through the ring of fire and emerge stronger as the Phoenix. 
You have to destroy your old self,  old habits, old customs,  old preferences to become something useful again.

Destruction will lead to creation. Destroy the worse habit, create the better habits. 

You have to choose your path, nobody will walk for you. If you want to become healthy, you have to eat good food and become fit. Someone else cannot do it for you. Your dreams are just for yourself,  somebody else does it, it becomes their dream.
