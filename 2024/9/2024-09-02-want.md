Want

One has to have great dreams.
One needs to work daily on dreams to live .
Living like a zombie without a goal to pursue becomes hopeless in the long term.

Each day, measure yourself against a goal. 
How can i improve, what can i do better.

Dont let setbacks make you lose faith in life.
Each life has to be lived. Each life has to be pursued with a vengeance, a story to be created.

You are the architect, creating plans for your magnifcient castle. Making the hard choice to build it. Dreaming big without constraints.
You are the constructor, pouring down the concrete on the foundation. Working on the long term plan, continuing the habit, each day by creating part by part of the castle.
You are the brick layer, each moment going towards your dream. Each day and hour you are focussed on the goal.
You are the janitor and gardener, keeping the place fresh and clean. You shutdown the weeds that crawling in, you do everything to maintain the state of the mansion in excellent state.

You want more from this life. 
You are not resigned to your fate. 
You have not accepted your current life as the final state of life.
There is a lot to achieve in this world. You have to dream it,
You want to have the best that life offers who work for it.
Work on your dreams each day, improve the controls that you still have in this world.

Become strong, today is a new day. Today you want to live more
