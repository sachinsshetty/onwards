Joy of Old faces

Time does not dissolve the old relationships. 
Even after multiple gap years . It seems it was just yesterday.  All the memories come back of the good times spent together. 

Life jumps 11 years since the first of meeting. 
Nothing has changed from the first days. 
Everyone stays the same,  we are the still the goofy people,  with a little grey hair's showing our age.
