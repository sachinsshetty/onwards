City Lights - Dubai

Flying into the city at night. 
I could see the ships anchored away from bay.
reflecting their light against the sea.

The city lights will come sooner,
everything made into dimensions.

How a thriving city in a barren desert can be built with a Vision. 

Many other regions have fallen into disarray with the influx of oil. Dubai has stood tall, 
leading the change with new energy and young blood.

Does the city hold any opportunity for my milestones. The city has been creating opportunities for AI into it's projects. 

Build your prototype sooner and show it's demo to people who are in need of solution. 

let the city of lights,  show the way forward.
