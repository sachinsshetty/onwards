Military Discipline 

Peak physical fitness is necessary to make inroads in difficult situations. 

You cannot be sick and weak and expect yourself to climb a mountain. 

Stop the leaks from everyday work,
Become efficient as a robot and get things done. 

Embrace new discipline, it will help you to reach your goals early and with enough energy to enjoy  the fruits of your labor. 

Work has to be done, there is no skipping amy tasks. Become disciplined with your effort, 
A focussed task will get the things done faster than a disconnected process. 

Lethargy/entropy is the death of systems.

Like the military,  follow a disciplined system to accomplish the goals with precision. 
Your work is dependent on precise outcomes. Everything is deterministic without involvement of errors.

Expel all error causing outcomes. Go to the next stage,  stop wailing hapless in the dark pit.
Come out in to the light. 
The magic is within you, use it .
