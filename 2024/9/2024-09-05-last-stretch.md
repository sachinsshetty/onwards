Last Stretch

Your losing the prize, because you stop running the last lap.
You cover the initial laps with furious speed,
Overcoming the major handles.
The last stage of closing the deal, you become disinterested and drop the ball. 
Stop abandoning project's,  nobody cares if it uses the latest tools or if it is made from magic.
Does it work, thats the only stuff that matters. 

Do not give up till the final lap is complete and you are on the champions podium.
You build really good stuff, make the effort to close it beautifully. 

You have the intelligence,  develop the patience to close the loop.
Learn to win the medal, do not become content with just a participation certificate. 
Its the survival of the fittest and the excellent.  

Take note of the entire race, learn everything .
Show the winner potential that you cultivated when you started competition before. Do better than the last time.

Upgrade all your projects one by one.
Prioritize space based projects, show the world how it is done. Understand what you learnt. 
Always create the document. You will need it again and again .
