On device learning

We propose an FDIR method based on telemetry analysis using a fine-tuned LLM to automate Satellite Operations.

The sysyem analyses the data stream from sensors and provides/suggests patches to the code when an anomaly is identified.
The sysyem ingests Data-shets of all sensors and automatically sets the thresholds for sensor's.
We define a set of of System prompts which are procedurally generated to reduce failure of systems.

Can we find this ?
The system was able to identify corner scenario's which were not anticipated during planning of system.
