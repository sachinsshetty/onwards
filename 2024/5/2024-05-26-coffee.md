Coffee

Coffee has been the top discovery of human productivity aceeleration. 
My mind becomes a haze without the first cup of coffee in the early morning phase.

By misfortune, i realised that (long-term) depression was prolonged due to the unavailability of coffee. 
Too poor to afford milk and coffee, the doom loop terrible.

Now one day without coffee, makes the entire day foggy. Take a mug of coffee and brain becomes super clear.
Sometimes you understand the notifications/things too late, build the habit to make a cup of coffee early morning. The day will not go any worse.

Coffee boost + long walk among tree, plans get expanded into detailed execution steps. Next 3 hours of work can follow the path analysed by the walking mind.
