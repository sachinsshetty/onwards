Breakthrough

When you fix focus on solving a problem, exploring new avenuues and experimenting with different execution path,
the problem will untangle itself like layers of the onion.
You have to strike/analyze the problem to convert into small chunks, which becomes possible to accomplish with every day program.
The whole problem would be to build a Gigafactory, at the outset it seems impossible to accomplish at one shot. 
By dividing the problem into smaller experiments with different resources, the parts will eventually merge to become fully complete.

A single large breakthrough will not happen and should be expected when solving any problem, its a combination of tiny breakthrough
occuring each day in the pursuit of a solution.
