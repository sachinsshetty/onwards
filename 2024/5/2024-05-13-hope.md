Hope

The world is a beautiful place, there is hope to build a new world in our small universe.
Make choices to be/live in a simple world. Take less and give more, contentment will go a long way in the world. 
Do not spoil and do not waste, Preserve and create the natural beauty of the world.

The flowers are blooming again, the smile and cheer is back amongst the crowd.
Live out a while in the warm sunshine, breathe the fresh air, drink cool water and eat fresh fruits.
Live simple, dream of the future and work for the present with high conviction and integrity.

You write because it clears the worry of the mind, it makes you happy,
it helps to orient your actions towards can solve it and not in my control.
we are not writing for validation. Future readers will not set the direction of my hobby.
