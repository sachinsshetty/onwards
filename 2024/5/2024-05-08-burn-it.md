Burn it down

Make your life as sharp as the tip of the spear.
There is no holding back of your internal power,  put everything into your dreams. 

Dont let life bog you down,  you are part of stardust, shine brightly till the last atom.

The world belongs to the doers and the dreamers. Do it now, make your daily contribution. You will not know anything at the start, become a good student and learn everything that is available for you. Study and execute,  study and execute,  every master started as an apprentice. Make your goals visible.
Stay in the light always, banish the dark to the end of the world.

Stop complaining about problems, find the most immediate solution and move on. This life is short, to harp on the past and miss out the present. 

Ambition should be carried on your shoulder everyday with curiosity,  you will attract like minded people with enthusiasm in everyday activity. Become an opportunity creator, do the work each day with focused detail.

Rocket science is possible, you only need to look for it.
