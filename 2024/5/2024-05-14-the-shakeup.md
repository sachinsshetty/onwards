The Shakeup

Overload of caffeine without food intake brings a heightened sense of activity to the brain. Dont take too much caffeine in a day.
Today was 4 cups of coffee & 3 cans of Redbull. The heart becomes restless making the head spin out, your max limit is 3 cups of coffee in the day.

Your context switching & FOMO will derail the progress. solve only 1 problem in a day. Do not stretch yourself thin, you will not make lasting progress.
Finish the task you are hired for & 1 extra project as a hobby. You will accomplish more with gradual progress, dont lose your progress with procrastination and doom scrolling.
You are losing out the daily progress by switching your mind off at the end of the day. Stick to your goal, the path is a loop. You have to process the changes and include it in your life.
