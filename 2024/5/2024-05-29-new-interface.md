New interface

New interface is unlocked. Proof of Concept - Natural language query with function calling support is complete and successful.
We can now trigger/call existing functions(python/javascript) with a text query, interfacing it with command line for MVP

Inference can connect to Mistral7b model running locally on PC/laptop or GPU server. The earlier requirement of high end GPU is no longer applicable.
System can be run on any machine.

Now the experiment move from POC to production grade software development using LLM inference. Connect the system code(structured data) to get potential results. Voice interface for dashboards and status information becomes possible with Open Source.
