Today is  a really good day to make your mark in the world. Turn up to your task, make the necessary work without skipping and providing excuses. 

The work of a master is built with constant learning and experiments, become an apprentice and learn with humility,  make discoveries with constant questions to improve your craft.
Find collaborators on your path , show your interest and curiosity with persistence and dedication. 

Complete all your assigned tasks. Dont fall down in trust order with excuses and lies. Hold yourself  to the highest standard and set your personal records. 

Today is the outcome of the prayers of the past.
Now that the old prayers are answered, make effort for the new prayers to come true. Your future is in your own body and mind, make the outcome you desire. 

Start to build with your hands in the physical world, far too long you've been re entrenched in the digital cell. Make organic and long lasting designs based products.
