Joy of Creation

Live with joy
Whatever you do,  do it with joy

Joy of creation is important for long term contentment,  Create your own contraptions,  do it just for fun.  Make crazy designs and have fun creating something new.  
The necessity of likes and reviews have destroyed hobby creation. Just be present today.
You can get more out of life and be receptive by just slowing down your senses. Go to a park and sit in a shade,  drop the entire need to accomplish even a single task. Dont try to create memory and record any events, just be here. 

We have lost the art of being joyful for zero price. 
Not every event has to be in a ambient place.
