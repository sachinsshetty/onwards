Smile

Life is too short to hold oneself back due to the past. We all have a very long life ahead, it's upto us to make it colorful with our pencils.

I barely know how your day is spent. I just hope to see the smile, I hope that you're not holding yourself back from achieving all the goals and dreams you wished for.

Wherever life takes us, remember someone would see the smile from a long way. Keep spreading the smile and sunshine Wherever you are
