Set a high standard of excellence as your personal benchmark, 
Your everyday activity should include atleast 50% as high value work. The days will fly past if the benchmark is not validated every single day.

Set a target for the day, make detailed plans and execute the tasks with high priority.  Each day spend time learning to solve problems.  Avoid postponing important work,  you'll end up with sub par work with deadline looming and have to make difficult trade-offs. 

Never compromise on your ideals, not to impress others but to avoid failure from negligence.
