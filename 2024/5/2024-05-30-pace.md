Pace Accelerates

The pace of development now increases up a notch. You have to keep up shape else you'll be pushed away from the wave. 

Keep up the grind and dont slow down. When you build up your pace continously youll achieve the escape velocity mandatory for Rocket launch.

Find your cohort of makers and creators,  keep up with them and you'll go a long way ahead.  Enrich yourself and others with the experiments and knowledge gained. This world is built by the dreamers, the perfectionists, make the roots grow.
