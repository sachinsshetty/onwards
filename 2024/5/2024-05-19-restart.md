Restart 

You fall down, You pick yourself up again.
The more effort you put now, when you have the energy and opportunity
The less hard it will be in later times, this year will be the last chance to make amends for th the last 5 years.
The world is going thorugh a new wave of change, ride the early waves.
Do not be hit be the wave, you can do it now. 
Do not be afraid of taking the risk, Not going against the comfort zone will make it uncomfortable very soon.
