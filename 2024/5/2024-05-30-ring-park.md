Ring Park

An amazing location spreads across the circumference of the city. Ring park is a breathtaking creation allowing nature to co-exist with human settlement in close proximity.
The lung space for fresh air is a boon for health, walking across the park each day should become a muscle-memory. 
The entire exercise will take 1 hour each day. Long term use of fresh oxygen from the park will lead to better standard of old age living.
You will live for a long-time, make healthy decisions now to reduce repair and maintenance at old age.
