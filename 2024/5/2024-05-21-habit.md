Habit 

Practice doing only 1 activity for 3 hour at a stretch without being distracted. 
You will complete more tasks in a week with this approach rather than jumping tasks every hour. 
Set your system to work in a contained environment,  reduce all the external dependencies. Lead yourself with discipline than with constant motivation needs.

Set yourself daily targets and make the sacrifice of not being pulled by wasteful activities.  If you do not avoid comfort and pleasure now, your later life will be terrible to survive without the foundation that you ignored to build. 

Habits create winners,  you want luck to favor your path, then invest your time in stopping bad habits and replacing them with good habits. The difference between a champion and the spectator is path of perseverance.  One made the dream come true, the other person just watched as the time crumbled the day dreams into nightmares and regrets. 

The road not taken will have much more regrets in the immediate future, take the reins of your life and direct its action to a specific goal. 

Will your daily actions fall into the attentive winning bucket or the inattentive failing bucket. 
Make use of the conditions available now, they will never come back again. 
Did you accomplish the best outcome that is/was possible today.
