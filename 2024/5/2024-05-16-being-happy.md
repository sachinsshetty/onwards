Being Happy

What will it take to be happy in this world ?
Why has envy pervaded in every form of existence ?
Food, transport, health, body has now become a battleground of comparison & path to depression.
Many have lost the game of life, by purposefully ignoring the good things in life. Gratitude has gone down the drain.

Wellbeing is personal & thankfully not measurable. Build your own reserve of peace, lead of life of contentment. 
No need to showcase your wealth to all and sundry. Its ok to not to do anything, dont offend yourself with the talks of others.
Each of us have one simple journey, Be happy, this life has been good.

Gratitude Journal is a component for peace. You have to learn to become grateful everyday in life. We take many items for granted & expect the world to be better for us.
