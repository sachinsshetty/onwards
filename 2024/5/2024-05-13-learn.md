Learn

I used to stop myself from starting simple projects, because my professional experience displayed false status and that I should only attempt moon-shots.
My trick is to start with a pseudonym, there is no inherent baggage and staus to carry. You can make mistakes like a beginner and sky will not crash.

Creativity and curiosity is supressed with increase in prestige. This is the only life we get, create the hobby anew.
The more you experiment, the better the fun. Never stop learning, the only person stopping you is your own ego. Acclerate your ideas wuth alternate persona. 

Learn again with the tools you missed in previous attempts.
