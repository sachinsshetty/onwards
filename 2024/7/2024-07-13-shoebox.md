Shoebox Home

Current home is made like shoebox size,  tightly arranged for bare bones living. You can only sleep here,  suited for a single person. Another person cannot move around without crashing knees.


The last home felt like a manor with large space and ample light for all activities. More than 2 people could inhabit the place with enough leg space.

Surviving in the small space,  will build up the grind to survive on Mars.  The conditions will be hard,  testing one's resolve to handle extreme discomfort  

The pioneer will have to battle the difficulties And overcome all problems.  You will have to fix problems of every kind.
