Ambitions

Ambition coupled with perseverance and hard work will lead to success in the next phase. 
You have to keep at it, for the outcomes to have a positive.  We give in, far too early before making enough progress for success to make its progress.

Aim/dream to such a high target, it becomes difficult to accomplish in a lifetime. 

Far too long you've stumbled across in the dark, begging for scraps of money and love from anyone around. Your mind has fragmented by constant need of a dopamine hit. Re-orient your sails to a higher ambition.

Let ambition and excellence in any task you start be the motivation to begun and discipline to continue ahead. Guard your focus with an iron fist, stick to the problem, don't keep jumping hoops to keep the mind entertained.
