Listen

Listen to yourself,  it wants to tell a story. 
You are listening to the commentary of Stangers. 

Listen to the stories of your mind,  
Do nothing for a day,  just stay still with nature. 
Reduce the exposure of bombardment of rage across the world.  

Don't let turmoil disturn the inner well of consciousness. Understand your place in the world,know that time is irreversible. You cannot get back past memories and fix mistakes. 

You can only look forward,  build your castle . Build your aircraft, build your spaceship.

Stay true to yourself,  dont lie to yourself byi sabotaging your glorious future with substandard effort. 

If you want something,  younhave to work extremely hard for it.
