Connect the Dots

You can only connect the dots in retrospective. 

To connect them, you need to make new dots.

You have to push each day in a new experiment. 

Every new experiment to improve the status quo, will inherently change the future. 

You want to win a contest, you have to work super hard for it. The contest should be the only thought on your mind. 

You have to eat, live and breathe preparing for the competition at every awoken hour. 

Win it,  its in your destiny. Pluck it out of the air, make the preparation to win. Dont live anything behind
