Making the Habit


Wakeup early 

Read good books 

Eat a balanced diet

Go for long walks

Disconnect from media, keep your brain under utilized, it does not need a dopamine hit every day. 

The code to Mars Habitat,  will not write itself. 
You'll have to guide it,  build it and nurture it.  
Think everyday,  make the idea work.
