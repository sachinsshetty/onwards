Lose It All 

Looks like we are going to lose it all soon.

The past has come back with retribution. Forcing to take what was built over a long time.
The past cannot be changed now. No respite by brooding over split milk.

Only way is to make FU money. We cannot achieve it by working for salary in current practice. Effort will not be compensated equally due to unavailability of profits in short term. 

Create a lot of products. Throw it out in the market, build your refutation and expertise by working with extreme focus and deadlines. 

There is no future in settling down with someone who is disconnected with your Mars dreams. Stop wasting your precious time and attention on making an unlikely outcome. We do not have the resources and environment to succeed in the space. Remember the stabs of the past, dont let it get to you again. 


Increase the odds of your success by making a lot of bets with your work. With each dedicated experiment,  you increase the livelihood ot maiing it out alive.

Use the turmoil as motivation to never fall behind. We will win again, we will not fail. Eliminate everything that's going to stop you. Let your mind soar high, complement it work. No castles were built by only dreaming,  it needs to be built brick by brick.
