Misery 

Only way out is working extremely hard 

Solve problems and bounties. 
Earn money to pay back debt. 

No more wasting time.  

Build on your strength, 
if your technically strong. then make projects that will generate revenue. 

Aim for the stars, you'll atleast fall on the sky scraper. 

The great achievement took time and extreme effort. Start from the beginning and keep pushing.

Not giving up is the only way to build great work. 

greatness comes from persistence and diligence.
