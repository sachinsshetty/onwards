Claim the future 

You want the prize, you have to pay the price.
You cannot wish for the wealth of someone else without the discipline and work they have completed to reach the stage. 

There is no shortcut, you will have to learn the foundations to build the spaceship.
You can outsource the work to someone else, to do that you need to create an additional income stream to supplement your ride to Mars.

The future is right in front of you,
Can you claim your path,  you have all the resources necessary to make it. Only grit and persistence is missing , its the main ingredient.  You cannot do work half heartedly. Be the finisher, everone gets the same 24 hours. 

Become legendary, do not let time fade away into nothingness. Dont put yourself into situation where you have to apologise for broken promises.  Dont make the promises, dont live outside your bubble. Live within your means, dont expand your debt trap. Lets fight it with all our means, this is the only way. Learn voraciously,  get into the flow state with practice. Abandon all distractions, let the most important work lead you morning.
