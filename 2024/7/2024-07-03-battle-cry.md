Battle cry

Nobody is coming to save you from your misery.
Nobody is coming to fix your household,
Nobody is coming to solve your financial problems.
Everyone needs to do it for themselves, there is no alternate options.
Accept the bad days as an aberration. 
Discipline with daily plans is the only solution to grow up to the next stage, you cannot to expect to wander in the dark without doing anything to reach the castle.
No lottery is going to fix your miserable finance and debts. 

Consider today again as the resest point. Clean up the house, cook your meals. Inventory all items and make the list accessible. 
Imagine a tool that can help you build things with these inventory. 

Focus on your everyday goal. Think the problem through, dont run away from making progress.
