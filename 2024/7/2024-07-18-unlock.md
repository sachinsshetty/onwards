Unlock

Dance like there is no one looking. 

Write as if you're the only one who will read it, 
 
Don't write to impress others.

Write to unlock the mysteries of the world with your eyes and ears.

Write poems,
Write novels, 
Write essays, 
Write haikus,
Write textbooks.

You are the audience,  
Let the brain wander, 
let it creates castles on the clouds of Venus,
let it make race tracks on the rings of Saturn.

let it fly.
