Helpless 

Today, i am helpless to solve family problems.
Last year, i was helpless to solve my own problems. We've made some progress in the last year. 

By next year, i hope to able to solve any problems that occur with self and family.

In the next month, i want to pick up exercise and improve my state of health. We've done this a few months ago. Its time to reclaim energy for the long march ahead.

Fear of terror has gripped the last few months, debts of the past have come calling. The immediate future can only solve the interest payments.  So one has to plan finance rigorously and not make binge purchases. 

Slow down a bit, listen to the call of the birds.  It's not a difficult life today. Stop letting the fear of the future, derail today. Study slow and deep, knowledge is paramount in this current world. 

You have everything with you, make proper use of it. Let focus on a project guide your life, 
You cannot invent everything in a day. Build the project piece by piece. That's only way to make a strong foundation for the project to solve problems. 
Show the demo and then tell the world. The world only sees complete project and not words in the air.
