Shape Out

You've to be fit,  not to look good. 
But to be able to handle emergencies.  

If you need to run 5 km to find medical help.  Time is absolutely essential. 
Build your pace soon,  don't keep wasting time on screen .

You look like an out of shape basketball. 
Pick your self up,  stop the wasteful life. 

Sharpen the mind with good books,  
The body with exercises.  Do good work and on time.  Stop giving up prematurely.  Build up your reserve of energy.
