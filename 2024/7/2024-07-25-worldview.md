Worldview

Stop consumption for a week,

Expand on what you have learned, read and understood.

Do a mind-map/knowledge export.

Remember the minute details in this week, build the mind-map accumulated over time.

Quantity is no matter, we can later filter the works. 

Consider you have finite time in the world, write the biography without filter.
