Roots

Back to the roots now.
Write down your thoughts on paper.

Make llm's generate the expanded code view.

Gone are the days of outdated template's.
Its accelerated computing on a scale never seen before.

Use the llm as a collaborator/pair programmer. It augments your work with explanation.

Do not expect it to do a SWE job end to end.  

Set low expectations, prepare to be astonished what you can build with support.

You no longer have to work 10+ hours each day.  Think deep for 2 hours, use the next 3/4 hours working along with the llm to build your application.

Errors are now handled fast with alternate provided.

If you are not using LLM , then your surely missing out.

Dont mistake code generation with original thinking.

You have to think through, what you want to accomplish. It will help you create an outline. 

It will not do all the work while you saunter. 

Like an vehicle, you are the driver. 


You need to start the vehicle and take it towards the destination, 

you are no longer making the physical effort  of travel 

but using your mental skills to drive it.
