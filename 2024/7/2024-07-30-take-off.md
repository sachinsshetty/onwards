Take-off Speed

Sadhana / work has to be done to acheive sadhane/ results.

The amount of work necessary is constant.  It has be done in continuous phases with total focus. The olympic winners have a fixed schedule to peak at the right time. 
To build a working project, you need to put the effort continously till it is complete. 

Set high standards to yourself,  make something useful for yourself first. 
When your experimenting anything, use it to solve your own problem first. This helps to verify and evaluate the solutions with your own benchmarks. 

Do the things that do not scale, the problem space should be small, do not generalise everything at the start. First draft, should be scrappy and just enough to work. 
Like lego blocks, you are just building something,  it doesn't have to solve world hunger. 

Start small, tackle the problems one at a time. 
Build enough template's/ recipes to increase your take off speed.

Solve the unsolved problem of your own existence,  dont under estimate what you can acheive in a year of constant effort.
