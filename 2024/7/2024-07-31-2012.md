Assignment project for Android used a variation of RestAPI,
 If only i had continued to build it by talking to others,  life would have changed with a different set of opportunities. 

Its the same phase now, mobile intelligence is getting unlocked, i have to push forward to break barriers and make it work.
The first versions will be terrible, 
Got to push it again, will build the next revolution of intelligent devices.
