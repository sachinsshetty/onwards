companion 

Someone who put my ambitions to the task with greater goals to pursue.
Someone whose ideas are above the society chatter, they are the frontier people, people living on the edge with their targets. 

Not a trophy wife/husband are happy with the status quo, not someone to maintain domestic home activities. 

We are living on the cusp Space exploration,  i would not want to be tied down. 

It shouldn't become an either option like build great things or have a comfortable life.
Comfort is not an option, better to stay a bachelor than be disturbed by domestic fights. 

Its a personal opinion,  want to surpass the great inventors of the current and past century.  Have grown up reading their paths taken. Will not diverge from the path to greatness ever again.
