Hobby Projects

The ideas made much progress, when i stopped trying to fit in a new framework or language to solve the problem. 

Hobbies are to learn and relax. Providing the brain a relaxing activity. Once i stopped putting deadlines,  it made much sense to do experiments on a idle mind. 

Ideas need constant fuel and long term gestation. You cannot climb Mt. Everest on day 1, but if you learn to climb each day, Mt. Everest becomes just an exploration with the skills learnt over time.  

What do you need ? What problems are you facing,  stick to a problem.  Finish it to 100 percent.  The last mile is difficult and once you learn how to polish a project. You can use the skill for next ideas. 
What you start, finish it. It may no longer look shiny, learn the full cycle.
