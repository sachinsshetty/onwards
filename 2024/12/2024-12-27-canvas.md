Canvas

Everytime you feel stuck in the doom loop.
Just breakdown the bad habit.

You can still rebuild your canvas, 
We have lost a lot of time,
but its not going to be the end of the world.

Today is the best day for a new start.
Forget the world and its pace. Think slowly and move in the right direction.

There is no option other than winning, 
Think hard, think deep. 
Plot out all the points, Work furiously on your goal.
