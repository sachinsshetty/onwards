Winter blues

Unable to do the basic things, Bring in your best self.
Become competitive, build and sharpen your intellect.
Tackle hard problems, do great work. 
You live only once, do the best, make the best of whatever you do.
Lock-in, do not lose focus. Give one thing your last best shot.
Stay strong, Gaganyatri.

Mental Models

Solve problems with first principles thinking.
Think hard about the root cause, how can you make it work.
Identify the path to proceed forward. You win not by taking the best plan,
You win by consantly updating your plans. You try, try and update everything.
