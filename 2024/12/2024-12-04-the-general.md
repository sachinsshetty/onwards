The General

All great generals started as rookies.
They put their entire life analysing the battlefield and taking steps consistently.
Every great leader understood the importance of speed,
You need to move fast, constantly improving the battlefield knowledge as your proceed further.

Moving ahead is a risk, not moving ahead is risk, staying in the same location is a risk.
You need to understand the risks and get going ahead.
All plans are tested against the first encounter.
You will face constant and infinite obstacles,
Your goal and drive is to find the solutions at the each obstacle and proceed ahead.

Every obstacle has a solution, you need to speed-run the problems and solutions.
There is no infinite time and infinite energy.

Become the general, lead yourself first with strong discipline.
Every morning will be difficult, there will a 100 different problems to solve.
Choose your battles wisely, choose the most important one that only you can solve
and needs to be solved for the battle to proceed ahead.
Stop taking on nonsense quests and unreasonable issues which are a waste of your time.

You get to live only once, today is a great time to win battles and expand your area.
Lead ahead with your best foot forward, there are no bridges to turn back.
You are all on your won, But now you also have an army of intelligent system to support you.
