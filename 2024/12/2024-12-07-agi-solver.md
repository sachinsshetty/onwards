AGI solver

- Make it solve problems, store the solutions in a global store.
Like a transformer,recursively understanding the problem.

- Build a thinking machine, give it a problem, provide additional constraints. Let it solve by experiments, like o1 thinking recursively. 
Read papers  on recursive agents and Chain of thoughts.

- Explainable AI
  - teaching assistant like Karpathy AI project
  - In text, ask it a question.
  - Provide explainable text in UI.
  - Show hint on how to solve with examples.
  - Pass this prompt Image/Video Generator
  - Let it create a series of output, connect the output visually.

- To explain concepts to students, request if student has understood.
  - Provide smaller responses, to give better understanding for question.

- Prompt to Video/ Theory to Video
  - Like einstein's approach for problem creation and thinking model of the world.
  - Create a pathway in the maze.
  - Run the maze a million times,
  - Each time update new parameters from previous runs
  - Understand monte-carlo simulations

- Solving a problem
  - Write the idea
  - Write the steps to solve
  - Write simple code
  - Execute the programs
  - Update program based on expected results.

- Current problem
  - Build a generic agent to earn money

- Problem solving agent
  - Given a problem
  - find all available information
  - create an instuct model for the problem state
