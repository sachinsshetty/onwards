Bad luck and Trouble

Bad luck keeps knocking again and again.

Still standing tall after being knocked down.

Immediate future looks bleak, without employment and debt neck deep.

Atleast momentum is going ahead with work on Sanjeevini.

I just have to keep my head down, write more code everyday to bring the project in shape.

Discover everyday how the project will unravel with your daily experiments.

Give it time, change the way you work and get things done. 

Show your skillset with an amazing product, You can do it. 

You have to do it every day. Update your daily schedule.

Avoid trouble at all costs, dont splurge. Keep expenses completely down.

Make use of your time. When you are going through hell, keep going ahead,

You will get out of hell.
