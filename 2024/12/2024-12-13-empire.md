An empire is built by its people, not just the Head.
Build amazing things, so that you can create an empire.

Do not ask for the shoes,
Run so fast, that they will sponsor your shoes.
You need to build it first.

Nothing will be given on a platter, 
No greatness is achieved by wishing.

Put in your 10,000 hours, Put in your 10,000 iterations.
