Mid-month

A week has passed in obscurity.
A shot in the arm brings back difficulties.
You improve your discipline, you get back on track.
Get the jitters off, shake off the issues.

Keep the momentum going forward.

An empire is built by its people, not just the head.
Build amazing things, so that you create an empire.

Do not ask for the shoes,
Run so fast, that they will sponsor your shoes.

You need to build it fast with urgency.
Nothing will be given on a platter.
No greatness is acheived is wishing.

Put on 10,000 hours, put in your 10,000 iterations.
