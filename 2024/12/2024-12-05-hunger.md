Hunger Again 

I need to keep working hard.

To never be like this again. 

The hunger is frightening,  

The knocks on the door,  terrify the soul being homeless in this harsh weather. 

Don't want to be jobless,  homeless and hungry ever again.

Don't give up,  don't forget your past mistakes,  never repeat them again. 

Come out of this misery.
