Hunger Again 

I need to keep working hard.

To never be like this again. 

The hunger is frightening,  

The knocks on the door,  terrify the soul being homeless in this harsh weather. 

Don't want to be jobless,  homeless and hungry ever again.

Don't give up,  don't forget your past mistakes,  never repeat them again. 

Come out of this misery.

5 December- remember the date

Remember this day, 
When your floor has vanished and your falling down again. 
You need up beg again for food and boarding. 

What has this life come to?
Your misdemeanors are crushing your life,  
You cannot let yourself down again. 

Please stop , please stop repeating the mistakes that has brought you down on your knees.  
Respawn again,  bring out your best self.
