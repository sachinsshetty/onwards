Highway of Life 

3 decades of travel across NH4 shows the progress the state and country had made.
Barring the construction period which had lots of growing pain, now the roads are a breeze. 

With a well maintained car, 400 km of distance is possible in 5 hours.  Earlier it would take 7 hours for the same journey to travel. 
The number of journeyman has increased 5 fold over the decades, helping more people in the journey of life. Some travel for vacation, some for work, some just walking around, some in search of a new adventure. 

How much has life progressed can be mapped across the buildings created with new opportunities for many people,  road construction has given opportunity for thousands  with daily work. 

It gives hope to everyone to make a start. It doesnâ€™t have to start as a milion dollar enterprise. 
Many stop at starting stage,  we underestimate value creation of a long term enterprise. Time would pass and we end up regrets of not starting early. Wherever you are, begin with anything. Persistence and quality is the metric that defines the success of the enterprise. Build your idea into the open, you will find collaborators to make the idea into life.
