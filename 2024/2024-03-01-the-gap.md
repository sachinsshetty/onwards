The Gap

Break in a habit ends up becoming a new habit.
You need to remember why you started,  so that you dont give up easily. Discipline is and should be internal fire, that does not let go of the push.

Dont let the gaps throw your long term goal astray, remember the end, remember the last failure due to the break. 

Stop going after others, instead look inwards and give the same effort to one's goal. Lots of time is wastted in adulation of someone else.

Now we put the energy into focused work, today we are at the start point, there is nothing to do for the lost time. There are no shortcuts, we have to go ahead from this point.  With the available energy we will move mountains and make miracle machines. 

The beginner/apprentice cannot have an ego. He needs to learn eveey single thing. He needs to show up on time. Nothing is for granted, we have to earn everything ourselves and earn it now.
