Easy wrong 

If something complex seems to easy for you, then it means you've either did not understand everything correctly or your skipping something and its not working the right way.

We have to experiment with many things in life, there is no straight forward answer to lifes complex questions. 

You cannot solve all the large problems at once. That doesnt mean you should not try anything. 
Better to concentrate on the hardest single thing first and then Optimise it later if possible to other things. Dont try to fix everything at once its impossible to do it, itll take a lifetime to find the singular solution .

Solve the problem that your currently facing and give out the solution to others. Because definitely many people would be facing similar problems that you had, your solution may not be perfect at first, just bring it out and then improve it later.
