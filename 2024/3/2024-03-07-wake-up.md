Wake Up

Wake up , get ready, run 3 miles, exercise your muscles.
Start your work.

Do not try to do many things.
Do not go after shiny objects.
Do not lose track of the current problem. 
Do not forget the mistakes of the past
Do not forget the lessons learned.

There is no way to delay the standard course of life, why delay and take the penalty later.

Wakeup the genie inside you, with your work bring magic into the world. This is not the time for second guesses.
