Moment

This moment is not my life. This moment is only part of the life in a long cycle. 

Happiness in this moment will eventually pass, Sadness in this moment will also eventually pass. Dont lose hope, that you will never get happiness back in life again.

Dont lose hope, that you will never get happiness back in your life again. Dont lose your nerves and become anxious, that you will lose this happiness forever. 

This moment is only but a phase, There is no eventual or total failure in this life. One might have failed in only one phase of life, it does not predict/foretell that you will always be a failure or doomed to suffer.

This life is meant to be lived, Nobody is a total failure, Not anybody is a total success.

Keep trust in yourself, keep building on your long term idea everyday. Perseverance is only way to achieve new milestones in life.

Even if you have given up, You can always start again. There is no penalty for starting late in the journey of life. 

This is your best moment to start again.
This is your best moment, to continue on your journey towards everlasting creation. Do your work in such a way, that tomorrow's version of you will be proud that you started & continue building on your work.
