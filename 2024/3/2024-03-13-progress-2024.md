Progress 2024


We've improved our life parameters infinitely compared to 2020-22. 

- The sleep cycle has improved,  
- Clean and tidy surrounding has become a constant.  
- Job security looks good in the immediate time frame 
- curiosity and attention has come into the game
- since a month,  we are actively exercising for peak fitness
- food is on the table,  though there is a knife always hanging with debt.  Need to plan to manage it properly


My only comparison is with myself,  looking back we've bounced back from acute failure.  
The progress is happening,  we will maintain it actively for the future. 

It's a long life ahead,  we will work on long term goals and align ourselves to do good work each day.  

The days will forget,  but the years remember everything
