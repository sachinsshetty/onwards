Wave

Intelligence in a simplified form will be made possbile with robots.
The machine's will have simple understanding of the world and start to respond with people with a human touch having wide expertise across domains.

With calculations running in a distance, network access will be the only requirements for Robotic intelligence. One does not have to run a very large computer 
on the robot, it will receive instructions for new tasks from large skill repositories. Over time it will learn from you and modify its interactions to reduce frictions and get to work autonomously.

Give it a list of regular maintenance work, it will get the instructions and do the work regularly. All this is now possible with Open Source AI.
We have to connect the systems and make it go ahead and build the Habitats on distant lands. 
Start with the tasks that are dangerous for humans, the Wave of robots with Intelligence is going to come soon.
We need to shore up, build your own robots to make it a simple world. 
In this case if Ultron is developed by Mega Corps,  you will have your own resistance with local Jarvis.
