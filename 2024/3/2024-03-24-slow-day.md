Slow Day

If nothing happened today.
If no progress was made today.

Once in a while, your body shuts down to recover from the frantic pace of the last few days. 

Take a long breathe, go out for a walk.
Read your favorite book again.
Eat a nice meal at your regular diner.

A slow day is fine, fill up your reserves.
We are going to Mars, We need to build an arsenal of skills and resources to live even for a day.
