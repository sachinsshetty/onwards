Redeem life

What to make of one's life 

Is this difficult moment,  forever live with us

Will this difficult moment go away after a while.

How do we handle the demons of the past?

Do we live again in terror of the demon ?

What can we do to delay the onset and become useful again 

This life can be redeemed again with constant toil. It will take 5 years to become net zero again,  we will take the next steps every day.  
This is the way,  no other path can reach the destination with known inputs and without lottery.
