Hermit

You need to understand the world does not revolve around you.
Its a chaos everywhere, those trying to build some order with it.

The cost of lost opportunity is greater than the cost of mistakes. You have to trust in yourself to do the right thing. 

Build for the next 10 years, do not be swayed by glitter in any form. To reach Mars, One has to live like a Hermit to survive 
on the red planet.
