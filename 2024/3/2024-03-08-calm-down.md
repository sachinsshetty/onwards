Calm Down

Calm down the mind over the weekend. Store the knowledge gained for the long term. Give a small break to pursuit of information.
Make the sunday, non-digital day, use your senses to see the world at a slow pace.

The world will still be here, it has not run away. Yes, the process ahead is steep, but it is not impossible to keep going forward. As long as we are doing daily/weekly progress, life will become better.

Look inside for answers, you can do it. See the world as it is, Remove the filter that is shutting you down. Map all the resources at your disposal, what you can do best for it ?

Become the best at your existing day task, use whatever you can get. The entire world is moving forward, do not have false ideals and withdraw permaturely from the comptetition
