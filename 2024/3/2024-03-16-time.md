Time 

Time flies when you are distracted with the whims of the world.
Time disappears when you lost catching up to the digital world living like a zombie, pretending to be someone and having something to show.

Time answers to nobody who is not demanding of its compelte attention and Time only responds to the one giving it the topmost attention. Attention to time and prioritsing long term goals is the only way to make anything in this life. 
Gather deep knowledge, build your focues to concentrate for a long time. 

Your mind is both an apprentice and master of time.
