Magic of Time

Time disappears when your busy looking at others life and their creations.

Time slows down when you focus life on your growth and build consistently without distractions.

Time's magic is only understood when its gone, 
Many time we let the present wash away instantly, expecting to do things right the next day. 
Tomorrow will bring its own sets of tasks and repurcussions of the last day's mistakes.

Hold your time wisely. You have a choice on how to grow ahead. Do not think it is impossible, to the ones pushing ahead, the goal gets closed each day.
