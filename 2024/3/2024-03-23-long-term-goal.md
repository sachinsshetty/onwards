Long term goal

All the milestones in life is possible with a minimum decade of continuous work.

We are all capable of completing the milestones that we can dream. We only need to keep pursuing it without getting sidelined.  Maybe we need to put blinders like the one's on race horses which make them run only on the path defined ahead. 

Dream big, keep the goals to yourself and include collaboration only when youve detailed it to a proper plan. Nobody wants to build castles in the air, we should a proper path ahead and make some progress with it. 

Only making tall claims is no longer acceptable,  with the advent of accessible AI , trials on difficult problems have a suitable guide. 
With a navigator to give hints, there should be no problem intractable which was earlier only possible with large corporations. 

This decade we can accelerate progress of human ingenuity to the maximum extent.  You can build as much you can dream, you need to persevere to become the best. Never give up, there are no dead ends in life, the knowledge we gain on the way makes the next steps less difficult.  

Step out,  make the change that you want with the world. You have an unlimited potential within you, you need to build your own motor which can move the world.
