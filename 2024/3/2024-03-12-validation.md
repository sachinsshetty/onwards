Validation 

Life's been miserable because there was no validation for the effort/affection given for others. 
It's been the pursuit of pot of gold at the end of rainbow,  always going after the next shiny thing. 

This life is short to only look for others for completion,  we are sufficient ourselves.  
Instead of avoiding the problem,  now is the time to focus on the beast. 

Our idea for Autonomous agents on Mars, is now possible with LLM. We only need to apply our problem to the solution. 
We are close to what we always wanted to do,  become a part of the Stars.
