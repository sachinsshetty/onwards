Patience for Goal

The scarcity mindset makes you think only of the current need. The future is affected because you did not build on the goals. On the path where we had to move up a gear, we stopped and fell back into ignominy.  

Its been a month of Exercise now, though there is no considerable weight loss, we have built a good stamina and can build on it. Its alright to have some gaps in between due to external factors. 

Do not give up when you are ahead, train your mind to continue the process of excellence. We need some wins in the register, the last few years have been total loss and with a known reason being lack of focus .
 Now we know the problem, lets continue to build on the solution.  Its only a matter of time, before the tide will change. Since its a matter of self control, the war within oneself needs to improve. 

We need to fight for greater things, 
Fight to achieve impossible goals,
Fight to become a better person.
