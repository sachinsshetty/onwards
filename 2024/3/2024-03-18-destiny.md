Destiny

What you are today, will not be the future you forever.
If you build for the future, your future will also change drastically based on how you do it.

Everything works in exponential cureves. 
You do good work, your outputs will raise exponentially,
You do nothing, your outputs will fall down exponentially.
You do bad work, then nothing can prevent failure.

Its is not final, you can pickup from your current state. You are re-adjusting your timeline & base you foundations to grow higher. The only compeition is yourself in the long run. 

Nobody else will provide for you, what you can create each day is all that matters. You are the master of your destiny, every day you have an opportunity to fix your direction towards your life goals. Each day's change will not seem much, but when you look at the year gone-by, A lot would have changed, nothing stays constant.
Everything might look same, its only because we dont want to see some things and we cant see some things because they're occluded.

Became aware, see things as they are. Dont be occluded by others filters. Independently arrive your own logical conclusion. Exposure, climax and conclusion are the diffrent things that come in phases. Dont skip the queue, you will have to cross all the hoops.
