Clean Start

A clean start to the day is the best way to clear the mind of past responsibilities. When the home is clean, the workplace setup with the bare necessities only. The mind can work on important problems, rather than having tinge/tickles about not having the desk tidy.

Build immunity against bad habits takes an active dose. Diagnosis has to be done & the medicine/activity to fix the ailments should be followed continously. It does not matter that the bad habits is completely terminated, its only pushed to the background. Do not allow its ugly head to rearback in difficult times.

Start again, Start anew, Start clean
