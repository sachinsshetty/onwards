A month to go

One more month to visit the homeland.
There is a war to win before making the retreat. 

No second measures to the end, we will push ahead with all the might. 

Double the effort for the Second round of the push,  every day counts for the exams.  We need to have deadlines to make consistent progress,  the time of mindless gazing has ended. 
 
Make the first push for the Starship -Test 3 mission.  You are a software creator,  you are getting good at it,  keep learning the tricks and get ahead in life.
