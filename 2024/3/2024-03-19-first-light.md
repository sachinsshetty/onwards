First Light 

When your awake at the crack of dawn.
Entire day is at your mercy. 
You csn shape the day against the best made plan's. 
First shot begins with runnign for 5 km at a slow tempo to get the blood flowing fine.
With sweat on the brow, the war is already half won. 
After the workout, the next few hours is a litlle precious time to work on your topmost prioritised goals. 

Kepp the streak going for a week, a month. In a year you would be unrecognizable from your old self and you become unbeatable. 

Always keep a measure on you progress, 
You dont want to negate progress with an accrued bad habit picked along the way.

Time to max one's time allowance. You need to become strong to survive an hour on Mars.
