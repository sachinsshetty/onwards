Preparation 

Everyday there are fixed number of tasks to be completed,  
One cannot push them to the next day,  it builds into an mess that causes extra effort to fix.  
Tasks that take 3 minutes or less, should be immediately as they occur.  
No tasks can be skipped , better to do it the first time itself than try to handle multiples .

The morning start should be like a rocket launch,  just wake up and take on the important task.  There shouldn't be any pending tasks from the previous day, that would delay and derail your important activities.  

At the end of the day, all the major tasks should be completed.  Make each day as a simple activities that can be done without putting extreme and hurried effort.  We need to live with grace , see the future and plan for it.  
We have overcome many obstacles,  let's not make mountains of it and struggle.
