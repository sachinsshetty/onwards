No shortcuts 

Bounty of any kind needs to be earned the slow/ organic way. 
If its unexpectedly put into one's hands, without the skills to utilize it correctly, the chances of losing the bounty fast is very high. 

If the bounty of knowledge in the form of book/machine is endowed, without knowing how to use it extensively it will end up as a dead weight or go into the hands of someone else.

If the bounty of wealth comes without the manual of building a portfolio.  The rate of loss of wealth becomes very high, since one spends on every other thing that catches the fancy. With large wealth involved, unknown benefactors will turn up from anywhere seeking it's share like a bounty for themselves,  just like you got it.
