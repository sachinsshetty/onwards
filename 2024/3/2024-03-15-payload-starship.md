Payload for Starship 


Building the payload for Starship to Mars is the personal frontier to accomplish. 

What will you build ? 
What will you take ?
How simple will it be ?
How robust should it be ? 
What resources can be utilized?

It looks like an impossible job initially,  but carefully built idea with multiple/innumerable iterations should help to the make dream/goal possible. 

As Paulo Coelho said ' One day you will wake up & there won’t be any more time to do the things you’ve always wanted. Do it now.'

The fever dream is now in motion, let it consume my entire lifetime, but we will land on Mars, either in bits or whole body.
