Plasma and Water

You are water, finding comfort wherever you are now.

You are plasma, buzzing energetically in all states to make the next milestone. There is no settling down, move things forward, make your surroundings clean and better.

Do not hold back, do not hold petty grudges. Reduce friction to move things ahead. Do not lose your state of calm for small tasks, have zero expectation from others, instead set yourself to a higher standard. 

To survive on Mars, you need to train to survive difficult situations. Learn to solve tasks each day. The way of Gaganyatri to operate at a level of top excellence.

Every day, we grow, we observe, we learn, we surpass.
To Mars, forever.
