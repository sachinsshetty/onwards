Disarray 

By just changing the filters of life, Our life can be seen as either Amazing or Tragic.

Amazing when you count the blessings you have received, hope of a better future and work/things going in your favour, the same life looks tragic if you keep counting all things you lost, the people who lefty and the dreams not accomplished.

Each one of us has the ability to make it better in life, instead we keep fighting to open the closed door. Accept the reality of life, Move on with life, if things do not happen according to your wished, take a different path to get your goals.

Look at the good things life has offered, dont always keep looking back for the opportunities lost. Life will give as many opportunities as you keep creatingm, but remember there are only so many tomorrows. Do not be in Disarray your whole life. Get yourself in order, hard work is imperative, only with consistency would any goal become possible.
