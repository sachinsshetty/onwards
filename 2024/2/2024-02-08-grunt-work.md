Grunt Work

Put your head down and do the work. 
Do not fight unnecessary wars,  focus on being the absolute best in your field. 
Each day,  you need to learn something new and incorporate a little bit in daily life. 

Share your knowledge frequently and present them to interested audience.  Don't only just speak,  let your work do the majority of the talking. 

There is no shortcut to the top,  you need to create a lot of value to the places you inhabit.
