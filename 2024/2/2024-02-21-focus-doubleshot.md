Focus - Double shot 

Improve cognitive tasks each day, 
Build focus by building on small tasks, compartmentalize code work into experiment, refactor, merge and build. Keep focus on the important work first, reduce distractions by switiching off doom scrolling at the first hit of problems. 

Note down the timestamps when the mind starts to wonder.  Keep the log of brian activities with timestamps. We want to build endurance of focus every day to activate flow state and maintain it for longer period of time.

With your work, fix all the existing problems,  do not let it slip your hand by building a mountain. Use a scanner to give you everyday reports.  
Tackle the top objective at the start of day, at the end of day do the required refactoring to sanitze the work. Attempt for perfection with more trials with work, read the projects from top competition and commonly maintained projects. Make sure work reaches standard level of compliance.
