The Race starts

In the heat of the race, you keep pushing ar the max limit till the finish line is touched.

You take the right path to reach the end goal, No detour/ distraction will let you win the race. It is great to build and win everyday battles, but the vision should not wander until the war is won.

There can only be absolute victory, no prizes for second place and giving up goals in the middle of pursuit.

The race has started, keep delivering each day, remove the blockers instantly if they diverge from the mail oath. We have only one shot to Mars, need to be perfect to be at the top of Astronaut group.
