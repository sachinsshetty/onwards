Remember My Name

Today, 27 February 2024, ISRO introduced the 4 astronauts for Gaganyaan mission. All are part of the IAF test pilots squadron, Group captain's and Wing commander position.

My name is Sachin Shetty, remember the name. I will also travel  to space. This is my life's only goal. I have started at 32 with a role for CubeSat operations software. I will build my expertise to become an astronaut. There will be no other goals. 

Each day we will equip Gaganyatri to convert dream to completed milestone.
