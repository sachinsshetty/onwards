Progress

Its easier to criticize as something not done right, but then what have you done yourself to get ahead. Work in progress is better than work not started & not interested to Work.

Change the way you see the world, there are many problems, but also many problem-solvers. Everyone is doing their best to push the needle ahead. Dont criticize for things not done correctly for lack of resources. But you can criticize if it was due to lack of commitment and focus. Show that you too can build amazing machines, start smell and keep building each day. You can dream to but/stay in a castle, but you also need to know to run & maintain the castle for a long time. Long term success is only possbile with long-term work.

You need to learn the basic building blocks, to use anything temporarily you may not need training. But for the project to last and not fall down, you need to know how every item works.

Progress will be slow,
Progress will be hard,
Progress will be expensive,
Progress wull be time-consuming,
Progress will take you away from leisure,
Progress done right, will last you lifetime.

Dont skimp on work, show-up everyday, Build your dreams, help others to build their dreams too, Dont lose your identity in the crowd.
