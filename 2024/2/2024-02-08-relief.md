## Relief - Weight

Weight has lifted from shoulders after a long time.
The future looks a little more hopeful,
Doing the right thing at the right time is necessary.

Soft deadlines will be death on Man, so many things expire without a warning. 
Keep progressing each day, do not carry too much burden by neglecting the important work. Make the best use of current resources. 

No more shortcuts, each day will a new day to finish well.
Drop the weights, become strong to grow ahead in life.
