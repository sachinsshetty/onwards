Fade Away 

Every story needs to come to an end. 
We think we are the main protagonist and do unethical actions and hurt others in the process. 
We could do no wrong and justify all the wrong deeds. 
The chapter closes today,  better to fade away than to come back again and cause misery. 
There is always another path, take a different route now.  Do not force yourself on anyone,  instead push yourself to achieve lifes toughest problems solved
