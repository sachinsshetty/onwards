## One track mind 

Shut down everything else. Quit reading everyday news, peoples feed, sports results. Its not adding anything to your goals, you need to focus on your goals. The task is gigantic to solve and complete. 
Do not let any distractions come in the way. You wish to be an Astronaut,  start living,  thinking, eating,  breathing and working like one. 

This is the shot at the future, learn everythin anew, only you can stop yourself from your dreams and goals. Do not settle for less, we go for Mars !! 

One track mind to get there, learn all about the necessities for Human Spaceflight. 
Everyday read one paper and abstract to live on the moon. Build your ITN software and make a curriculum out of it to spread knowledge. 
Start acting like an Astronaut, take the lead, be the Best !!!
