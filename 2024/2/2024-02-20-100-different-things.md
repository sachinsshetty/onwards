100 different things

Want to do a hundred different things everyday. 
So many things to build and showcase it to the world,  tackle the problem closest to your heart and dreams.  Shower undivided attention to it each day for few hours,  once you've made good enough progress,  you can rest by switching over to the next pressing item. 

You cannot go back and fix the past,  instead work on the missed goals today.  The future can be changed by what you do today,  the arc will change.  Nothing is ordained,  your fate is dependent on how diligently you do today's task.  Don't skip on responsibility,  make your existence worthwhile.  
You can do a lot of the 100 things,  observe the time that disappears when you're looking at other things and losing it without any pain.
