Pain, Good

Muscle pain is not being felt, Just one day of intense workout, has made path for new muscles. Old one's are being closed to build new changes in body structure.

Running a good pace on the treadmill, is the start of good pain. Each day add one minute to daily run. Goal should be able to run a pace of 1 hour daily. Laps should be 5.5, 6.5, 7.5 and 8.5 kmph.  Once we hit all 4 speeds, we next make it 3x * 4 speeds.
2x * 3 speeds * 4 mins = 24 mins is current progress, Add new speed 8.5 after 10 days.  1 lap of 8.5, 3 laps of 7.7/6.5 should be the 30 day target.

Build and grow the pain threshold through daily exercise. A simple person should be able to run atleast 10km on a given day to reach Mars. We will do it, adding one brick at a time to the University, Its going to be built soon.
