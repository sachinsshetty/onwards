Top Speed - Execution

Top achievers don't do many things all at once. Instead they put total focus & get the things done fast & correct.

Repair & correction should be avoided, since it will take double the effort to start the analysis & fix the problem. By doing many things at once, you lose the details easily and end up with mistakes.

When you close a task, it should be done completely, there should be no returns. Costs for context switch is high for any kind of distinct activity.

Become efficient with your work, do the repeated tasks faster to make time for new activities. Focus is the main driver for any execution, remember there are 100 million software developers worldwide, if you do not go fast you will be left behind. Your competition will not wait for you to catch up. Improve your time each time.
