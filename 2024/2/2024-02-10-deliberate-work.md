Deliberate Work

Choose your work,  do it deliberately 
Don't be distracted trying too many things. 
Every item should be actionable.

Read how companies failed,  how projects failed,  how ideas were lost.  There are failures which teach more than success , to avoid common pitfalls. 

It's absolutely necessary to be optimistic,  but not maybe naive in your transactions. 
Build good guardrails so that there is no catastrophic failures,  but not too many guidelines that curb curiosity and experiments. 

To do any kinds of collaboration,  first do the basic groundwork.  Your ideas should withstand basic scrutiny. Think deep and keep it simple, 
Continue to build every day,  it takes 10,000 iterations to achieve your grand dreams/goals/ideas. Time is expensive, use it wisely
