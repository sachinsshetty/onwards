Struggles

The failures, rejections, knockdowns in the pursuit of dreams are a challenge to sustain. Struggles end up consuming a large part of life. Its all worth it in when the dreams are made to come true.

Regrets are and will be worse, if you did not live up to your potential. You have to crawl back up from the abyss, re-learn the knowledge to grow higher again. There are no shortcuts, total effort is still required if you need to do it again. 

Past is gone, it is irrelevant for the present. Can you solve it now ? is the only question that matters. Keep equipping and updating your skills, dont ever hesitate to do the grunt work. 

You want to acheive something, dont wait for other, if it needs to be done. Just do it and get going.
