The Run

The start is terrible, the brain gives you all kinds of wrong signals to stop and take rest. Why wake up early morning & simply run in the cold. Instead we could be asleep on the cozy warm bed. The bad signals keep coming till 0.5km, once the threshold is is crossed, motivation gets loaded by strong landmarks to cross. 

Every week we are adding up 1 lap(400 m) to the total workout plan. Our target is 60 mins(8km) of top speed run. We are now at 35 min(4km). So that we can run the 10K run on 25th May 2024. Our pace is improving week on week, but we need to be careful not to overdo the run & result in an injury. 

We only need to become fit and reduce weight by 10 kg in a year.
Current weight is unstable and not good for long term health. We will reduce the total weight, by eating small portions and working out strong.

Parkrun on Saturday's seem feasible from 2nd week of March. We will have upgraded our pace to strong in 40 mins.

Week 1 - Feb 7:13 - 20 min
Week 2 - Feb 14:20 - 25 min
Week 3 - Feb 21:27 - 30 min
Week 4 - Feb 28: March 5 - 35 min

This week we need to maintain pace for 35 min & hold it. The day starts by crossing the biggest hurdle, its a fillip to one's daily motivation having started with a win. Every activity that comes next is just the second problem one can fix. 

We Run, Every day, Pound Sand.
