Fitness Effects

Mind no longer needs to binge watch to sleep at night. 
Body is properly exhausted to get a good deep sleep.
Running at breathable pace, also improving lung capacity for better cardiovascular health.

The lungs are happy with fresh air,
The ears love the chirp of the birds,
The eyes are comforted with the green of the park/land
The mind settles down to the flow of the river.

Almost a decade since sweat glands are used propely, improving the total body exchange. Glad to be able to reboot physical regimen for long term stay on Mars.
