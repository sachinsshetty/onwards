Redeem this life 

We have made many mistakes, followed every shiny item,  lost it all many times due to disharmony with self.  Procrastination has caused all the failures,  with so many things fighting for our attention,  no energy was given for the main and important task. 
Things became mercy at the cost of misdirected efforts.  We found solace in distraction, subsisting on just reading and creating opinion on others life.  
Pull the emergency brake today,  there is only one path that can be pursued. 
No time left for making mistakes,  be focused at all times. Stop being a wreck,  get your life together.  Stand your ground,  list out your priorities,  write everything down. 
Remove everything other than the top goal,  you cannot compete on all fronts.  Become strategic and street smart. 

Redeem the opportunity at your hand,  don't lose it again.  The times are difficult for everyone,  
We do or die,  there is no try
