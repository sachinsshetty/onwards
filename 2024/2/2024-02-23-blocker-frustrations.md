Blockers and Frustrations

No progress for a task, brings great strain. When you are used to spoon-fed instructions, making an own interpretation becomes difficult. Blockers cause a dip in motivation, making one wonder
'Is this the right path ?'.

The way forward is to take a short break, breathe fully in a long slow walk. wihtout any additions like music, notifications and phones as distractions. Come back with a clear mind, go slowly line by line. Dont jump to conclusions & expect success in the first attempt. Think slowly, there is already a way in the problem, its just hidden and waiting to be unlocked. 

You want to go to Mars ? Dont be discouraged by blockers and failures. You have no alternate options on Mars, the problems have to be solved. There is no way back, Drop down the baggage of the past, the expectations from others.

This is you against the world. You need to prevail.
