Passive Dreams

Motivation is short-time event, It gives an initial burst of energy, maintaining the curiosity & energy for an extended time becomes difficult & gets lost in search of the next high.

Slowly moving ahead with the earlier direction is necessary, to build disruption one should create a notification/display which shows the progress of the work giving feedback each day.

How do we stop our active dream to not fall into passive dreams, One that just stays in our memory & a part of regret, thinking - 
I should have done it 5 years ago,

Make a companion object/person/app that will help you to keep raising the bar. From now onwards Feb 2024, each activity needs to be logged. We will do speed-running of tasks to be efficient in our work & reduce time between tasks.

Do not let the top tasks fade away to mediocrity by falling into the  loop of procrastination. Social media doomscrolling and sub-culture acceptence mania. Time is limited & precious, do not ever push your Mars dreams to do something wasteful. Exercise, think, work, sleep. Nothing else should take away our time.
