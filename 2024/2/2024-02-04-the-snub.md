## The Snub

When you constantly let down others, shirking responsibilty and work that needs to be done regularly
Your character becomes sketchy, you are no longer seen as reliable, your actions have caused hardships to your dependents.

When you no longer answer to the hardships of the people who supported you in your difficult times, you lose their trust and respect forever.

When character is lost, you become a hornet's nest. People will avoid you due to instability and non-responsibility

Snub has begun noticeably now, With long list of excuses and lies given for non-helping response. One has become a pariah.
Do not make it worse, become active to respond to problems.
Find solutions and help at all times, It's no longer an option to become detached with closed ones, Show up and work.
