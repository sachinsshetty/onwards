Alternate Reality 

You need to take care of your dreams, 
Build your alternate reality where you work each day on your long term goals. 
We have a start on the health front, each day the muscles are being rebuilt to work in a high intensity environment . Life on mars would be building the systems with the hands, one needs to physically fit to endure the daily grind of a world creator. 

Make time each day other than the work which pays the bills. We need to bring it up to speed again. The alternate reality has to become visibile each day, like the jigsaw part finding its part in the whole puzzle.
