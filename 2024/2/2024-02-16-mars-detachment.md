Mars Detachment 

You are anyway going to go away. Why make anybody else wait in the future. You will not be committed to the person, your total commitment is instead to Mars. Do not spend time on false starts and for known endings.
You are the eagle perched on the pedsestal of sky, to fly higher than ever before in this world.
Become firm in your beliefs.
Out work, yourself 

Stop the chatter, remove the noise. 
Outdo yourself,  strategize your own life.  
Choose the best outcomes,  take the hardest and most important work as the first task for the day. 
Catch up on news, once a week.  Become invincible during workdays .
