No way out

Perpare everyday to become better than yesterday,
Better than last week,
Better than last month,
Better than last year,
Better than last month.

Today's work wil become the advantage for tomorrow. We have started on the back foot, we are still way behind to become on par with life. But with daily work we will take it forward, make it advantageous after a long long time.
