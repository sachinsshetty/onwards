Your hits  vs Human misery 

When i saw that my failures were ultimate and had completely finished me.
When i wanted to give up life entirely because i couldn't find the way out of the puzzle
When i thought that my failures will never leave me behind and take my existence down with it

All my hits were due to the drramy idea of perfect existence, where i got only success for all my undertaking.
I have not corrected my reality field to todays world. There are some thing's that are lost and i cannot get them back, all future efforts are useless to bring back nostalgia. 

When i felt my breathe locking me down in misery.  
I saw the blind lady on the road, 
I saw her current helplessness to go about further ahead without guessin the possible problems and pitfalls that are fatal and injurious. 
I saw her taking one step at a time, being hit by hedges and tree branches on the way. 
The entire world seemed built to make her fail and fall down. 
How strong is her life force,
