Your hits  vs Human misery 

When i saw that my failures were ultimate and had completely finished me.
When i wanted to give up life entirely because i couldn't find the way out of the puzzle
When i thought that my failures will never leave me behind and take my existence down with it

All my hits were due to the dreamy idea of perfect existence, where i got only success for all my undertaking.
I have not corrected my reality field to todays world. There are some thing's that are lost and i cannot get them back, all future efforts are useless to bring back nostalgia. 

When i felt my breathe locking me down in misery.  
I saw the blind lady on the road, 
I saw her current helplessness to go about further ahead without guessin the possible problems and pitfalls that are fatal and injurious. 
I saw her taking one step at a time, being hit by hedges and tree branches on the way. 
The entire world seemed built to make her fail and fall down. 

How strong is her life force,  
even with total darkness engulfing her world, she was still pushing ahead. 
The world is mighty cruel to her, but her will of steel is able to push everything apart.


Lack of sight, has not stopped her to venture out of her home,into the path of the bustling world with cars, cycles,busses, trains,animals and people around.
She had not allowed her visual impairment to stop her complete life. 
That energy and will to get up everyday, not allowing impairment to see the world with a different sense. she has decided to do good with whatever she can.

I may not know all her problems,But I surely can understand that my failures and problems are not as insurmountable as the one's facing the lady everyday. 

You do not have to get everything right in your life. Accept the drawback if they come.

This life has enough to live well, live simple,  help others when possible.
Don't make it difficult to live in your head.
