Family time 

We spend our best days in pursuit of a new future. 

Time spent with family and siblings live longest in our lives.  Make the most memories with family.  
You only get a limited amount,  don't spend fighting for small inconvenience. 
After a certain stage in life, we wish to have the small things that are constant .

Counting down time and worrying about the future will only destroy the current world
