Strike Hot

Ideas keep flowing when a new opportunity presents. Create a small prototype to show 
its feasibility to potential users. You need to strike the idea into hot execution process.
Do not let the ideas die away in bureacracy & premature optimization. 

Build away with basic tools and single workflow. Do not use the current hype technology to build your MVP, 
more time is lost in learning the tech than with creating the idea. Use any knowledge or 
toolchain that you previously used for making progress.

Your idea should start very small and then be able to build up later based on new feature
and user increases. Understand that you will re-write everything after a certain point, Do
not let perfection come in the way of delivery. 

You do not build a large fortess, start with a small wall, You need to validate that your writing/building at the right place
for the right people. No idea is small. All the great inventions was started as a small 
idea and demo.
