Excellence

Extreme attention to detail is necessary to become Excellent in any task that you pursue. 
One cannot win the race half-heartedly, without wanting to win. You should sacrifice everything for the top spot in life. This life comes only once, you cannot live like a scarecrow, blown away by the winds of fate.

Make your own destiny, show your capability and make contributions everyday. Do not skip on details, observe everything that happens around you. Make the olan to navigate the choppy waters with efficiency. Focus on one problem, learn everything to solve it. Become the expert in field of your interest. There are no second chances, keep building,  keep learning.

Excellence is borne out of habit and not by chance.
