Trauma

Fear engulfs the body in the vulnerable state of mind. 
When misfortune has struck in similar stable, the body becomes over-active trying to reduce  the bad outcomes.

Trauma is a lingering feeling that will never go away. You have to learn to live with it, build a few walls/strategies to come out of the survival mode. 

Make plans to avoid falling into the state of risky environment. Entropy always bring disaster in the world. If something is not actively maintained, it does not live in the same state forever. It actively degrades over a period of time. 

If you don't follow your dreams actively, it becomes a regret and you'll only keep reminiscing the good times.
