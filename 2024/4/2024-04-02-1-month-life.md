1 Month Life

Work for 11 months in a distant land.
Far away from family and friends.

Make new friends and acquitances along the way.

Enjoy 1 month going back home.
Time disappears, We want to make so many memories.

The countdown begins two months early, with good thoughts about being home for a month.
We plan and plan, trying to fit as many things as possible in the short window.

At the end of the month, a wave of sadness comes over.
Realising the clock has reset again and the wait is now a year more.

This is what we can do, in the pursuit of dreams and a different way of life.
