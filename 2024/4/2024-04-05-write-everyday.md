Write Everyday

Its easy to get overwhelmed by all the issues seeking your attention.
The only way out of it is ruthless planning.
You can do only one task right with focus,
Do not chase multiple rabbits.
Plan,Execute, Re-plan, Re-execute.

A year ago. 
I used to write for acceptance from others.  Spamming link to family and friends. It was unsustenable due to low feedback and low reach. 
More than writing, beautifying website with jekyll would cause headaches. 

When I read that Meditations by Marcus Aurelius was never published and the philoshopher king wrote it for self-reflection, it unlocked an energy and freedom never felt before in journalling. 

Now i just write it in Markdown. Push the raw file to github. And once every 3 months, just export it to kindle and pdf.
Now streak is 100+ days. since i only need to write and edit for myself. 
Its time may or may not come. But the second brain is slowly being built day by day.
