Reality Check 

When your flying due to compliments of people. 
Reality becomes a bitter pill to swallow.  The castles are knocked down immediately as they were built recently on light information. 

Do not hate your current circumstance,  appreciate the good that has happened and be grateful to have gotten the opportunity to live a better life. Expecting 100% positive outcomes is a recipe for disaster, most times you will face difficulty and problems each day. 

Overcome your situation,  think calmly and with long term focus. This life is not all doom and gloom, there is a new sunrise each morning after a night of darkness.
