Train Stop- Hubli

The memories keep coming back with a visit to the train station.  This was a departure point for many of my travels and exploration into the world. 

The hustle-bustle of the platform, the old smell of the station,  people from all walks of life in various stages of life.  From the kids barely walking to the old barely moving,  it shows a brief time-lapse of the entire human life. 

After all the years, the pace of life has changed for millions across the nation. Gone are the days of long distant travel, moving across different state borders to reach the destination. Now one can reach the other side 
of the world in 24hrs. Whereas only a few can afford a airfare, the nation's carriage are the Trains. Everyone and everything is moved across hundreds of kilometers, the orchestration now looks amazing at the distance. Making everything work everytime is a world class operations and management.
