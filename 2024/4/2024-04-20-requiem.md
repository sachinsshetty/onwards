Requiem

A new day has come. 
Some chapters have closed, new chapters have begun. 
Everything is moving ahead. 
Time to shift my gears,  get into the fast lane.  

We will get life into perspective to do good work. 
Become better as a person,  
You have a new responsibility to become a leading figure.
