Sobriety 

When one has seen the devastation of alcohol misuse, the body/mind has created a defense mechanism of total reaction. 

When one is asked of being sober from birth and never interested to consume liquor ever in life.  It becomes amusement about ones intention. 

What I've seen over the years of people struggling to become sober and going months and years of non-consumption, they understand the virtue of never having to have lost in the maze.
