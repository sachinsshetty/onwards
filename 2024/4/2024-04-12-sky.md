Sky 

Limitless opportunity to build a great protection for the world.
Our earth has built its own defense mechanism against theats of the universe. 
Atmosphere stops any small debris and metoers thrown around thr galaxy,  Ozone absorbs harmful Solar rays. 
Its a living entity, always running to keep us safe.

We are own threats,  creating destructive machines which harms us and the everything that was provided to us by Earth. 
How not to destroy ourselves is a question that will stay with us forever. The frailty of life is forgotten after a few decades of war.  

We do not need another war which will bring doom to the entire world.
