Long Life ? 

If I knew I would be going to live this long,  I would have taken better care of myself - Anon 

failed at every instance of life, can no longer afford to make repeated mistakes. Get on the bandwagon, we are in for the long ride, prepare for the journey every day.

Imagine you'll live for a 100 years. How would your everyday existence look like ? 
Damaged teeth, weak heart, stupid brain, sore joints. Do you want to inherit above medical complications by continuing your current lifestyle. Or do you want to have strong teeth, stress free heart, flexible joints and a functioning brain at 40, 60, 80?

Do you want to suffer in eternity during old age or do you want to lead a strong and healthy life. Choose and follow your path today. Enough is enough, do not neglect anything anymore. Take the world by the horns and move fast.
