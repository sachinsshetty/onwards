Creation 

The world is built by dreamers who plan meticulously to convert the dream into a reality and then work tirelessly every day to keep the dream alive. They do not allow naysayers and setbacks to stop from working on their plans.  

Become a creator today.  Make any creation everyday,  your experience will build it into more expressive detail.
Fail by controlled experiments and not by inaction and undecided work. This world is up for the taking, how you see it and tame it will create wonders for you.
