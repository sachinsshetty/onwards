System Upgrade 

To acheive anything, complete dedication and focus on the goal for 1 year is mandatory. 

You have to stop distractions and procrastination on important work to make significant progress.
Bumbling around without focus and depth in the work will cause problems in the journey. You should be able to handle all the twists and turns accompanied with any major undertaking. 

Break the habits holding back your potential. Reduce your focus on the external world, start to look inside and concentrate on one's everyday tasks. How is one spending the hours of day ? 
What are the problems faced and solved over the course of the day. 

What new experiments did one undetake to get ahead from yesterday? 
Go back to the books, read, practice and write the foundations. Skimming topics will only help for smalltalk. When you need to build your idea into product/project you should be able to work with fundamental principles.

Upgrade your system installing the software/regimen for deep work. Remove all noise/social media and long stale projects.  Discard projects without immediate and long-term value, working on simultaneous ideas will split your focus and you cannot get significant outcomes from your 
project.

Lets start with a single clear goal, only the task associated with thr goal should be prioritised. 
Important work should never be at the mercy of busy work.

Mars needs state of the solution,  build the best product to solve a single problem.
