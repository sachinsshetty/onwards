Uphill 

When your creating anything for the first time, 
It will be against the status quo. Many will be worried about the lose of their status and income flow.  They dissuade in the form of negative criticism and theorizing the problem to be useless and not required. 

Make sure that guiding star is the people who are your actual target audience,  ignore the naysayers and keep building ahead.  

It will be an uphill struggle everyday till you reach the mountain top after that you need to maintain the top position. You will reap the benefits in monetary and/or knowledge and experience in solving the problem.  

Dont give up, don't die.  Everything that you wish,  is on the other side of the mountain.  You have to climb each step.  
The regrets of not doing is painful than failures. The road not taken will haunt more than the falls and broken roads.
