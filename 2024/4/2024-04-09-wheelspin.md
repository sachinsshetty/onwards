wheelspin

Oh how lovely the rush of air.
The way the earth becomes a blur with the twist of the throttle. 

The memory of wheelspin on the bike was hidden away for a long time.

So much grace. Makes me try again,  
Makes me want to see the smile every morning when I wake up. 
Makes me to create new memories everyday for a long long time.

Time - Count down 


It's only a day back home,  i already feel the dread of living alone again. 
Those days without an ear to listen,  my voice was lost,  the words never came.
