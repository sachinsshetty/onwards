No second chance is available when trust is broken with others.

You create second chance with your own life, make the necessary corrections. 
This life is abundant, create your own magic. Its alright if only you see the magic,
Everybody need not be mesmerised, slowly build your empire. Build it in public, do not
speak about it to everyone. When you do good work, you will attract people to contribute 
more. Do not beg for the shoes to Run, Run so hard that shoes will be presented at your
doorstep. If you currently lack opportunities, its because you were not deliberate in life.
Change your worldview, become extremely vigilant of your life and surrounding. Choose the
topmost competition and solve it everyday. The stream of oppportunities will trickle
down your path, you must make yourself worthy of greatness by hardwork. Luck is created
every single day, In 3 years your life will either become terrific or terrible. Terrific
if you fight against entropy and be at the top of your game. Terrible if you do nothing and 
just live an idle existence.

Keeping the streak alive without external validation is difficult and necessary to grow
 your idea. Do not give up, The great wonders of the world started with an idea and
 completed with relentless pursuit of excellence. Convert your idea into reality, 
each day you will be ahead.
