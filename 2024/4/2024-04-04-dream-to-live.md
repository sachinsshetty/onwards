Dream to Live Again 

We are living the dream again, 
Future looks bright with opportunities being available, when one is putting in the days of effort.

Each morning there is a little hope, thay the day will be better than the previous days and better than the dreadful months and fear of turmoil and depression. 

Lets build on the dream, making each day to pursue a new experiment to fill the puzzles of the dream.

Some days will not go as planned, but most days we can be in total control. We need to be deliberate with our actions, not sleep walking through the days. It is possible to make lasting progress in a few hours each day.

You want to want the things badly in life, that you will turn everything over to get it done.
