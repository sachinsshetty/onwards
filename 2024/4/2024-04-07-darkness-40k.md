Darkness at 40,000 ft

What does the pilot see at night

What instrument help her to navigate to the desired location 

How dependent is she on tools created by someone else, somewhere far, sometime ago .

What gives her confidence to pilot a huge beast into the expanse of the sky.

In the darkness, with blinking lights around her and a guide light to see ahead without actually being unable to see anything. This is the topmost of professions.
