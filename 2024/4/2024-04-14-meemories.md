Overwrite Memories

We have to stop living in the past. We cannt stay back with nostalgia and stop from doing the things and work we always wished to do.

Time to break free from the clutches of the past, there is an entire world out there.
Gotta overwrite the barriers that were holding back. 
Get going ahead,  make everyday progress.
Code everyday for 365 days, in a year life will change in leaps and bounds .
