Dependence

On mars, you are the only Person who will be working.
There are no cubicles,  there are no colleague's to solve your problem. 
Its entirely upon you to solve anything and everything.

There will be no guidelines, no daily meetings, no support staff. You should do everything by yourself. 
You are expected to build what is necessary with minimal supervision.  Feedback will minimal, objectives will be provided, how it is achieved os entirely upon you.

Remove all dependency on external people,  learn to become self sustainable. 
You are expected to be diligent and create product's based on high level inputs. 

Learn to do it now, stop giving excuses on others.  Stop blaming failures on circumstances. 
You have the intelligence to identify mistakes as they are occurring.  Ignorance is not an excuse, laziness is not an excuse, naivety is not an excuse. 
No excuses,  become a perpetual machine
