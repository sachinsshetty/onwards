Jackpot

You hit the Jackpot with the daily addition of consistent work.
You cannot hit Jackpot by luck, You cannot hit an unknown and unseen jackpot.
Nothing in this world relies on luck.
Luck is another name for outcome's after supreme work.
Like saving a part of monthly salary loads to retirement savings, you need to put the daily efforts to get the jackpot in 5 years.
Jackpots do not happen in an instant. Schedule the next 5 years as an ISS astronaut,
so that in 5 years, when the opportunity become available you are the choice.
Being competitive is necessary now, we will not be satisfied by participation or complementary prize.
We want the mission commander role.
