Death of a hobby 

Time is the great currency. 

How fast it slips, depends on the number of responsibilities. 

As you grow, your time becomes scant.  It's the same 24 hrs, but now its being pulled apart by many activites wanting its attention.

Drop the pretense of doing something. 
You dont have to create video graphic proof of every small problem. Do the work expected from you. 

Write down everything on paper, move away from the death of digital memory.

Create long term accounts, slow down each night.  Let your mind connect them as knots.  

You dont have to shout from the rooftops. What your creating is for your own path,  
Like marcus aurielus,  the path will be clear only to you.

Make a private life for yourself. Keep a part of you for yourself. You dont have to write a story for the sake of writing. 
Write for your hearts content. You are the only audience for your hobby.  

The distinction with work and hobby is separate. 
Be patient with your hobby and be active with your work.
