Responsibility

Your future would be on Mars,
That does not mean you give up on responsibilites today
Have empathy on your surroundings
Help and support your family during the times of turmoil
Being indifferent and ignorant is not a virtue of child/parent.
You've the enjoyed the gifts of parents sacrifice. 
You cannot shirk away from supporting them in old-age.
Nobody will do it for you, you have to do it / arrange it yourself.
You have to fix the leak when it is very small. 
Dont let it flood your foundation and destroy any future you can get with it.
