Excellence is a prized gem coveted by everyone in the world.

It is acheivable but involves a difficult process of constant practice with different experiments run concurrently. 

Daily practice is a fool-proof idea to achieve one's goals. Most give up after a month, year.
To be at the top, one has to go behind the goal for decades. 

You want to reach Mars, you keep learning everything. 
Start to make physical things with your mind and hands. Fix issues that you see around .
Nobody will pay you for Mars, 
You have to make it yourself,
You have to earn every minute on the Rocketship.


Your current work is a stipend to learn about spacecraft and Space technology. 
Use the time to learn everything under the sun

Become excellent with daily work, 
Show your skills to the world.
Do not stop your brilliance from shining into the space.
