Learn

So much to learn,  it feels that we are out of depth. 

Its alright,  lets learn it step by step.

You can remember more by doing , not just reading. 
Implement the ideas in a program

You can revisit it later, 
Whats written by hand, stays longers in memory.

What you didn't learn before, you can and should learn now. 
How can we reach the moon, 
By first going for a walk daily, then a run and later a marathon. 

Build a plan of action for learning, do the most difficult in the morning. 
Tick items out of the checklist regularly .
Keep an open schedule, but have the most important work always scheduled and executed. 

Learn for the long term now, use the knowledge in everyday task. Learn how puzzles are solved, 
How can they be solved mathematical.
Build proofs by hand.
