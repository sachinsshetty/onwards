Depression Alert 

All systems are crumbling again

Anxiety is at the top level

Stop all distractions 

Don't let yourself get destroyed again

I have had enough pain,  with the stress taking over body and mind.

Life is precious,  the opportunity that is created for you.  Will not repeat again,  take a step back. 
Gather you thoughts,  slowly come back to pace.  
It's not over,  don't let temporary setbacks become a permanent roadblock.

Excellence is a step of small habits 
Choose and inculcate the best path forward.  Stop the life of a junkie.

Your only 33, it's not the end of your world. 
Missing milestones doesnt mean that your a complete failure.  By 36 get your life back in shape.  
Forget all relationships,  all fun activities. 
Bring back competence and financial stability.  

Set yourself a daily time table.  

We will win the next lap. Not going to continue failing.  Disappear for a while.
