Turmoil

Where there is change of guard

A lot of turmoil of is created 

From a bunch of moral humans , few will let the blood lust take over and turn into animal's bringing on carnage. 

Mobs of any kind are dangerous for co- existing. 

History shows time and again the factors leading to disaster.  
Democratic movemnts have kept tyranny away in few places.  The rule of the land has to be same at all time to all the people. 

Need for power will affect a lot of people at the ground level.

Maintaining a state of equilibrium takes a lot of energy.  

We get only one shot at life, thats when greed takes over and we tend to make more mistakes. 

Minimize destruction in your own world, 
Create more positive outcome than destruction when provided a chance.
