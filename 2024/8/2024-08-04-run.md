Run

I know it  is difficult each day. 

When every morning we wish to disappear. 

I'm still in pain,  but I've blocked the memory away. 

Nothing changed after repeatedly grieving. 

I just decided to ignore it,  knowing that I've survived to this point. 
 I can survive again,

I'm running as fast as possible,  so that it cannot catch me again.
Swallowed it as a bitter pill, 
Now onto the next chapter, whatever that maybe.  

Suffering has to stop some day.  
You'll pass that stage too. 
Break out of the environment,
