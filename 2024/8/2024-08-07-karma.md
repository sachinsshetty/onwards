Karma

Life is a cycle

Your actions will come to support you or haunt you inevitably. 

A bad penny will always find you. 
Stop falling down the slippery slope. Immediately stop all the bad activities that you've continued consciously or unconsciously. 

You cannot always hide, you will eventually be found out and made to pay for the missed work .
You'll have to pay for the substandard work. 

Dharma is the only way forward, don't get untangled in adharma. 

Pay your penalty now,  stay thrifty. 

Stay healthy, stay sane
