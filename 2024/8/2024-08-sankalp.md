On the 78th independence day.
We are now in the pilot seat,
How we conduct ourselves,
We will conduct the operations of the world,  with the same intention.

How do we challenge ourselves to the next frontier.
How do we channel our energy into the impossible projects.
How do we project our hopes into the world.

Do your best each day ,
Bring out the best outcomes from each other.

How can you help others to build their life ahead.
The nation will need to be built with dreamers.

First become a dreamer yourself,  the become a practitioner of excellence. Build ideas into projects, you will find many explorers.

There are infinite explorers, work voluntarily on the toughest problems. Strive to solve the problem first,  rewards will follow when it's time is due.
