Sorrow

We are not alone.  We are part of a large group.
A group with family, friends, colleagues, neighbors,  public workers.

If one is person is affected by it. Then it affects all of us. The physical pain is suffered by one person, but emotional pain is shared by many. One can be detached for only a small part of life.
We all come back to family at the end of the day.

Humans are social creatutes, we can still survive being independent for a long time.
Independence works well when the society is running comfortably without major problems. If something breaks down,  then everyone has to partake in the process to find and implement a solution. 

Happiness stays for a short time,
Sorrow lives longer.  

Make as many happy memories with family when your together,  sorrow will inevitably haunt you for longer part
