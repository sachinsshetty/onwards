No

Human nature wants to do everything, It wants to pursue every shiny everything.
But human capacity allows for only one thing, that can be done at at time for a meaningful and sucessful outcome.
If you pursue multiple things at once, the ship will not go anywhere.
Your pushing ahead in every direction, it will be in the same spot.
Curiosity should be wide, but the work should be deep.
Say No to new opportunities to spend max hours in a day.
Allow yourself to Read wide and deep.
But do the important work first without being distracted. Time is finite, make excellent use of it. Not by doing busy work to be occupied all the time.
Do the most important work first.
The stars await our arrival.
