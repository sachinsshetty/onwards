Failure 


My past faiures will not define my future.

I will break free from the bad habits and wrong priorities which have brought to this predicament. 


I will not get offended because some else got offended at a problems. Keep the reasoning to yourself, you cannot make the journey for someone else. 

You cannot pull the wagon of an unwanted and uninterested journey. 

You have to walk the path solely by yourself. 
Whoever is on the path. You can wave at them,  you can join for the part of the journey if its on the same path. Or they might join your journey for the shared path. Don't keep looking for change in the same person.

Result's will come in 5 and 10 years. Like the Olympics which comes every 4 years, you've to keep trying at each opportunity. 
Opportunities cease to exist only when you stop making the effort. 

Your the only person responsible,  you can choose to do great work. Cross new milestones each year,  shed the old skin. Transform into a butterfly.
