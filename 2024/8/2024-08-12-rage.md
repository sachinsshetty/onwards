Rage against the dying light 

Fight till the end of oblivion. 

Do not ever give up.

Consider every setback as a dead end, 
Go back to the last turn and try again.

We will not give up the fight,  we have not suffered so much pain to give it up now.

Rage against mediocrity,  rage against entropy destroying oneself.

Actively remove bad habits, yesterday will not define the future. 

Do not make mistakes that cannot be reversed,  dont create harm to others.  

Stay in your lane, you have got it.

Breathe out the fear,

Let in new energy to conquer the world.

Trust the process,  in a year you will grow more by just turning up on time. 
Persistence creates long term value, 

Rage against the dying of light.
