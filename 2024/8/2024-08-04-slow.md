Slow Reading

For human understanding, read slowly. Write down the major ideas.

We are now speed running computer intelligence with large compute. Systems have been created which are solving
a lot of problems, You can just run them anywhere and port it your requirements.

Keep iterating your desings, validate your expecations across a benchmark.

If something is available, which can reduce the work and can be configured easily. Implement the new system,
If there is new data available, incorporate the data. 

The final path to Mars, is from a combination of million details. 
This path of million details can be speed run using Computers. But the final path to Mars as an objection has be done by human guidance.

Advanced systems look like magic, learn how they are built. learn by replicating and dismantling. 
Time is most important, choose the difficult and un-solved path. Not for glory but for exploration.
