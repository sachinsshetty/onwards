Problems

Solve problems like you solved the levels fo a videogame. 
It does not have to make money. Dont force yourself into building grand projects.
Build what is necessary and what can be useful.
Does it solve a single problem, then it should be good enough.
It does not have to become a multi-purpose tool and lose it original meaning.
Just keep building what is useful for you.
Dont try to build what other's may want. Solving your problems will give you immediate feedback.
Just make it work.
