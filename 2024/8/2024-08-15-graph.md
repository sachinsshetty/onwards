Life Graph Theory

Solve problems using Graphs.
Think of ways to make it work.

Goal is start node,
All branches are independent experiments. 
Create checkpoints/ no. of iterations to prune/continue branch.

Maintain global state to avoid repeat calculations.
Make every task in life a dynamic programming model.

Iterate the experiments with regular feedback. 
This life is a reinforcement learning algorithm,
know the states and improve efficiently.
