Anxiety 

Mind and heart  become tense when no progress is achieved. 

Keep one step ahead at a time. 

Dont let FOMO derail what is ahead of you. 

Read news every 3rd day, let the strong work percolate up from others. You dont have to process every signal in the world. Create a filter for yourself.

Work on one frontier idea only,  improve it each day. 
Start with no tasks, projects that will not get your full effort should be added to a list. 

Maintain a won't do list, predict the outcomes for the project. What do you plan to accomplish from it,  is it learning or is status, is it brand building. 

Push anxiety away with simple work each day, learn to plan the days .
Yes, we need money today. How can we generate 
it in the future, undergo thrift now for better resources.  

Wake up early, go for a walk. Make your body healthy to pursue the work in long term. You cannot reach Mars with a weak and diseased body and mind.
