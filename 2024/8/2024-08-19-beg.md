Beg 

When you skip activities you end up begging on the street within the year. 

Dont skip any activites ever.
Stick to your main task, in search of more gold due to greed don't kill the goose that lays egg regularly. 
Do not take advantage of others trust, 
Trust once broken can never be recovered, 

You have to fix thing's,  dont give excuse for your existence. 
Break out of this misery.

Entanglement 

You have to unlock the threads slowly,
Each thread has to be handled with care and patience. 
With untangled knots, life can proceed better with known stress and less surprises. 
Its not difficult,  you have to keep fixing it.
Giving up is not an option, stay strong.
