Live and Let Live

You should disappeat for a while.
Not to see if people will forget you,
But to know/realise if you brought smile and happiness into their life or frown and sadness into it.

You cannot keep pushing yourself into another's life, repeatedly doing it will lead to misery for both sides.
What you seek, the other person may not seek it. 
Temper your expectations of the world. Have patience with other's. but be strict with self's inaction.

Wish them well, if it did not work before, it will not work now.

Relationships are not a puzzle where you try to fit in yourself.
It is like to be part of an orchestra. You automatically fit into the wavelength. 
There is no active adjustment or forced embrace with life. 
Just  being with each others will be enough.
