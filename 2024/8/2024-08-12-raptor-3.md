Raptor- version 3

The latest version of Raptor is achieved after 1000s of iterations. 
They did not use 3d printing as the final design criteria.

First they main objective was created,  
To build the most efficient rocket system that would work on earth and on mars.

No other constraints was the limiting factor, 

From that initial spring board, 
The best ideas were collected and prototyped.
By trial and error the less efficient ideas were discarded.  

Think with the same approach, 
How can you build the automata.

Dont keep any constraints.  Like environment or language or system

Define what the end goal should be. Then collect the best ideas,
