Hot Pursuit 

What do you want to pursue ?

Is it a better version of you ?

Is it another person?

Is it a goal ?

Can you do the pursuit with existing resources ? 

Can the pursuit be complete in a week, month, year, decade ? 

There is nothing called as a lifetime, there is no future time available. 
Life can end anytime
