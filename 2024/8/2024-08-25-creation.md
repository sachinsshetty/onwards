Creation

Creation needs patience. 
One learns to create by learning the process.

Dont be fixated on the final outcome. 
As you build, you will discover new opportunites.
You will find new paths, dont stop yourself by stopping by pre-conceived notions.
Do not try to fit the project into known frameworks. 

Build versions step by step. Dont be worried about incomplete features. 
Dont build an entire castle in the first attempt. 

First build the wall, then 4 walls. Keep adding bricks only if necessary.
Dont build a bridge in the middle of a desert. Bridges connect unpassable regions.

Start with a plan to work patiently, the race has started at different times for different people.
Your race is with you, not against anybody else.

Create what you love, make it possible .
