Failure 

Not having discipline is the major cause of failure for many ventures in the world.

We do not learn from past mistakes ,
Our rotten memory hides the pain and we repeat the curse ever again. 

Dont let your failure define your life.
You can start over again.

Turn up earnestly each morning. Expertise comes during the 10,000 hours practice with 1,000 different experiments. 

Understand what was the reason for failures,  
Write it out on the door,  mirror. 
Don't be a zombie,  be the person that is curious. 

Lead yourself in good direction.  Stop taking on the problems of the world.  Stop battling imaginary demons.
