When you lose sight of your finance, 
Your debts skyrocket to infinite heights. 
It becomes impossible to have a semblance of life, due to the constant pressure to float above water,  without drowning oneself in poverty. 

After the large expense event,  
There was no money left,  due to inherent mistakes,  it also coincided with loss steady income.

One had to stop consuming drastically,  even making one meal a day was a uncertain. 
When you are in foreign lands,  it becomes painful to find hope,  a mistake can be fatal and you would be thrown to the streets.  The streets are unforgiving,  impossible to survive in this runaway world
