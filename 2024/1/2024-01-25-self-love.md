## Self Love

Love comes in many forms and is an essential part of  human existence to live in continued harmony.

We give our affection and love to the closest ones, we also expect a little love in return. Sometimes the love is not expressed directly, but show/done indirectly with the care and responsiblity  on has for the other person/animal.

Most important of all forms of love is self-love. One can only provide care, sipport, affection and love to others from the internal reservoir. Once we understand and accept that at first, one needs to care of self, pursue one's own ambition, trial with destiny, then one can empathise with the struggles of thers.

Empathy is softest form of love, understanding the other person, supporting them in joy and sorrow, moves the world ahead.
