## Distance

We can only go so far, As we can Dream
Last decade has just passed with a whimper.
To many years lost due to directionless journey.

Now that we have a fixed hard target.
Orientation and correction everyday is paramount.
Maintain prolific contribution to code, 
Build on your strengths, Can add other skills in parallel.

Distance currently looks infinite.
But now its possible to dream and make it a journey worthwhile
