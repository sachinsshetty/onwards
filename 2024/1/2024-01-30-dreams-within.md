Dreams Within 

Time flies away instantly like paper on a stormy day. It's forever lost, unless it made use of. Doing many things in a day to by busy, is akin to losing time. 

Take absolute care of your dreams, pushing it to another day in the future, makes the dream fade away, never getting its due time. 

What legacy do we leave behind, we've only been consumers for all of life journey, make time to become a producer. 

Stop the activities that drain your energy and dilute your time, focus exclusively on the dreams and push your life goals ahead. You need not follow the behavior of the crowd, there are many pathways to reach the goal. Build on the path that makes the gains to be strong and long lasting. Not an instant fling that comes fast and goes fast too. 

Nurture the dreams within, you will walkways regret not starting a decade ago. Compare only own progress, the trap of comparing with others will take you down the abyss.

Keep your dreams within alive, keep the fire burning, blaze your dreams to the world ahead
