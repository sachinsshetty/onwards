Bhakti - ಓಂ ಸಾಯಿ ರಾಮ್

A little habit change for self-care for the Bhakti consciousness of Shri Ram - ಓಂ ಸಾಯಿ ರಾಮ್.

Bhakti is internal prayer, devotion to the Entity in any way possible. Our Dharma doesn't measure devotion in currency, everyone has their own method devotion. Our culture has survived millenia due the inherent devotion which has carried across generations. 

How will my Bhakti make a difference in my life? A lifestyle change in a aspect to improve one's own life along the added clause  of Bhakti.
