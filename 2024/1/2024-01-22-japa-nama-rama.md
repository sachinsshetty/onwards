Japa Nama - Rama

Wherever one currently lives, bhakti is omnipresent connecting to all the places one worships.  

On this day, the world looks at Ayodhya. The return of the King to his birthplace after being displaced centuries ago.

We can push ahead in life, the fruits will come eventually. After centuries of Bhakti, the name reverberates across the Globe - Rama, Jai Shree Ram, Om Sai Ram, Jai Siya Ram. 

Chanting the name has channelised the energy of the devotees, to bring heartfelt joy towards everyone around. 

My own heart feels glad,  though I am 7000 miles away from the Temple, looking at the views from the city , brings hope to the soul. 

One's work will be fulfillment in itself, content in out hearts that our work is devotion itself. Results will reveal in due time.
