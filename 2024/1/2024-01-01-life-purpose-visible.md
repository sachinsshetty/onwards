Purpose of Life - Visible

All the actions in life till today, where for some activity which never really mattered. 
Every day was just another moment which passed without direction.

Today,  everything is making sense. 
I can see how each action taken every hour will change the course of life.

1. How will my eating habits from today,  make or break my body based on good stuff or bad items which will bring health issues. How does my diet affect my life process in 20 years. Drop all junk foods and ultra processed items, skip sugary carbonated water. Switch to consuming home cooked meals, fresh fruits and vegetables for a better digestive tract.

2. How will my exercise regime, match up the requirements to persist in Space travel and eventual existence on Mars. Drop the heavy paunch and build muscles in the right places. Become fit be able to complete a Iron Man. You will have to swim across oceans, walk miles in unpalatable spaces and pedal unknown distances.  What you need to be in 5 years, become the Astronaut now.

3. Utilise your intelligence. Become prolific Contributor to Human space research and telemetry analytics for Mission Operations. Relearn the Maths, physics and chemistry needed to survive in Harsh climate. Use your brain in a focused manner.

4. Make hard choices for life, do not linger in shallowness and run after temporary pleasures.  We will be able to visit distant planetary bodies. Now is the time to pull the ejection cord on Wasteful activities.

5. To Mars,  whatever it takes. Make the fixed plan and stick to it. 10 years of sustained effort will make you the best in the field. Do not let your soul die in obscurity.  Each day , should be a step in the direction towards Space exploration.  Inspire yourself and others with your discipline and single minded focus. 

Let's fucking Go !!!
