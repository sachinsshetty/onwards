## Game : Character - Entropy - Part A

Our life is a game.
A game of character building with strategies.
Each challenge (day) costing us time in return for health, wealth and alliances.

Entropy is omnipresent,  it erodes away the gain, if maintenance is not upto the standard strategies. 

We acquire skills to grow in exchamge for time and wealth,  indirectly using our health.

Its a open world game, No fixed main quest until you identify it. Most of the times, we keep playing the side quest to maintain basic quota to be eligible to continue playing.

How does one's Character,  acheive Hero status.
One needs to keep playing the game as long as it takes.  Many levels keep repeating,  unknowingly to our detriment , we would have not cleared it.
