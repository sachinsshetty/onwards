## The Call

First time in all existence, there was the call of help
One was kept in luxury and no stake in responsibility,
Everything was available, but was not understood.
There was a shield from Pain and suffering. 
One did not realise the importance of it
and kept wasting away life. Intentionally ignorant of the pain of others.
Now, When the call has come.
One needs to break away the shackles, the self created ties used to run way from problems.
Its not a mountain to climb, 
One only needs to direct life force to a fixed goal.
Answer the Call, partake in the difficulty and solve the problems together.
