Dream Mighty Goals 

Everyday we see the magnificent machines reaching destinations which were considered impossible a century ago.

What is impossible today ? What has mankind not made an everyday recurrence. 

Spaceships to Moon, Mars and planets as travel option is impossible today,  but a few are working towards it relentlessly. 

Make your own dream as mighty as being a planet explorer , plan to the finest detail and keep executing short term and long term work each day. 

Not a day and not an hour should be lost in the pursuit of the impossible dream.  The dream is now an Immovable object,  its our own faculty to make ourselves the Unstoppable force. 

Build your forge to create the machine to acheive the impossible.  We are made of star dust,  reach out to the stars
