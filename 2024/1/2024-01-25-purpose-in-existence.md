Purpose in Existence 

One needs to have a good work ethic. Each life should have a purpose as the guiding light for all their actions. 

Plan each day to the detail, take down the hardest problems at the start. Prioritize your goals, one can try a hand in many avenues as a past time, but there should be a guiding force to a single goal. 

Time is the precious commodity, we realize it only when it's over, then we see a mountain of missed opportunities and unfinished tasks.

Live a simple life of sustenance, but lead the way in learning and discovery of new frontiers. Become a proficient learner and builder of experiments.  Ask questions to self and other constantly, to understand if we are still going in the right path.  


Make the best use of time, focus your attention, do not diverge and regret for being punished due to things not complete
