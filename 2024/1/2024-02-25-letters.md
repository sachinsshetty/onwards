Letters

I will keep writing letters,
Words have moved nations forward,
It also helps to keep sharing happiness,
I have seen that my pain reduces when i write it our and joy increases whenever i make a note.
You will have to suffer a writer for a while.

Write everyday,
Note the execution to the finest detail.
Experiment the flow everyday, No plan is perfect at the first draft, keep revisiting. Second hand knowledge is good for the short term, if your work needs to solve hard problems,
You need to be hands-on with every detail.
