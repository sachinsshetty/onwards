## Dogged Pursuit

Pursuit of excellence requires knocking down problems every day
Problems keep mounting everyday, these small issues turn into a mountain
The mountain will always block the light, unless one keeps taking it down regularly
Problems will keep pursuing you, unless you too start pursuing solutions in force.
