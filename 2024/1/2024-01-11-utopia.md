## Utopia

You can only build, what you can dream

Utopia on Mars is possible, if you can create it.

Yes, the problems will be unsurmountable.

You have to become the Unstoppable force to change the Immovable onject.

Many things in life are inevitable,  its only a matter of when. Accept things as they can, 
Every challenge needs to be overcome. There is no escaping it.

Listen to the child in you. The one who dreamed about the impossible, the characters in the Scientific fiction. Write the book, that you wanted  to write. 

You want Utopia, build it today. What happens later, is of no consequence.  Knowledge of millenia is available at your behest, build it.

You build what you like, it should be only guiding light. Not for what someone else may need. Solve your problems with tech.  It doesnâ€™t need to be beautiful,  it only needs to work.
