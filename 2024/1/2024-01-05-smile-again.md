## Smile Again

Your smile brings joy thousands of miles away. Such is the mystery if life,
we are amazed how our existence brings solace & happiness to many around us. 
We forget to understand our own divinity.

Hope this letter finds you in great spirits, Each day is a miracle to withness.
Everything changes in the world, but still many things remain the same.

We are born to showcase our best selves. Not everything goes according to our intentions,
therein lies the beauty of life. A litte bitter, make the sweetmess feel mellow.
Today's pain, will be part of the reason for tomorrow's strength and gain.

I pray and wish for all the world's happiness to you. You help others in their existence, 
lending your shoulder as strength, to all those who seek solace in their turmoil. 
Hope you get a strong shoulder to rest and get support for your endeavors in life.

Wherever life takes us, companions come together to be only part of a journey. We only 
have ourseves for company. Life we be better, take care of yourself.

Hope to be part of your journey for a while to receive the smiles, which brings joy across the oceans.
