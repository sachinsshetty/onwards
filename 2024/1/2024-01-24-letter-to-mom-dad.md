Letter to Mom and Dad

Children go further than parents,  due to the sacrifices of Mother and Father during the most important time in the life of the child.

You have made our childhood safe in a nurturing environment, with your daily care and unseen sacrifices for years without reduction in your affections towards us.

Now that we've reached the age where you became parents, it's astonishing to understand the commitment and work that you did everyday, so that we could grow healthy.   The education you provided by neglecting your own requirements has helped to grow in life with a great foundation and a future full of prospects. 

Looking back, all your love for us was the safety aura which did not make us miss anything.  We got everything that we wished at the expense of your own dreams and needs. 

I will never be able to return the love in full, but I will try my best to live a good life.
