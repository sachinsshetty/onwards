Dear Sunshine,

Time connected us after a decade apart. Like long lost traveller's we speak once in a while, showing our existence.

I have missed you and your presence for a while now. Those short meets we had a year ago is still fresh in my heart and mind.

How much this heart wishes to meet you again and keep looking to catch your smile, your affectionate presence. 

How I wish I could embrace you tightly,  like two salsa dancers flowing as one in a soothing music.

How I dream to walk hand-in-hand along the seashore, the wind in our hair, the warmth in our hands and the sunset capturing timeless moment.

I pray that in another lifetime we could meet sooner, spending a life full of love together. creating our dreams and supporting each other in joy and sorrow. 

Hope is a potent medicine, Some prayers do come true, some dreams become real, some wishes are granted.
