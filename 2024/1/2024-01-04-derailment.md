## Derailment 


When we lose out on a opportunity. The world doesn't care, but we build internal strife reminiscing the lost future wealth.  What if ? If the question that troubles us the most in times of difficult and failure.  It's hard to come out of the shell of loss, we lose confidence in ourselves and keep avoiding everything for fear of extended loss. 


But what happens in the present,  is that the world is moving ahead.  The interest of death and taxes keeps piling again.  It's imperative to break the shackles and turn up at the starting point and throw the voice that stops you from getting ahead.  


Do not waste time on getting back to the same track,  the journey has diverged to a new path to pursue for the dream.  Let the derailment be a lesson to build our next adventure. The more your try,  the better you become and increase the odds of low turmoil in a future of less energy. 
Stop the slide downwards,  bring out the parachutes to slow it down and use it again a sail to become better. 


We have lost accolades, wealth, companionship due to misdirection , there is always a path to create new wealth,  gain respect and accolades from our daily actions towards a better future. 


Remember not to waste again,  the days fly past in a frenzy leaving only regrets behind if constant action is not undertaken.
