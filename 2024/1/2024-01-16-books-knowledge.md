## Books knowledge 

How does one listen to the thoughts of thinkers, philosphers and inventors.
Most of the knowledge was ahead of their time, understanding came after years of perusing the books written centuries ago.

How does one skip potential dangers from the things already done before, how can one learn from failures of others, if it was not journalled in a diary by a detailed writer.

How do you pass down learning and wisdom from a lifetime of trials and experiences to the future generations to come by.

Books in any form , is the highest form of democratizing education and bringing forth standards of people ahead in life.

Read from the history,  read from your own current society. There is always something to learn which unlocks the magic of the world. 

Reading as a hobby is recommended infinitely
