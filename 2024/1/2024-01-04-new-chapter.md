Each is day is new and brings out its own mysteries.
For a few days in our life, they mark milestones for change in environment,  habits, goals.

Today will be a milestone day,  a few activities will be added and some will be removed. 
How major a difference it would make on our life goals and dreams , depends on how we see it.
Make this day as an addition to grow in life.
Every person is responsible for their dreams, We only collect memories along the way.

Do not let it overwhelm you, with the attention the world showers incessantly for a period of time. Take joy on the start of a new Chapter in life. Its ok to be nostalgic of the changes it brings and the goodbyes that happend. Such is life , that it has to move on. For new wonders are to be explored and experienced.

Congratulations on the New chapter in your life.
