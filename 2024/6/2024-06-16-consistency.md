Consistency

To get ahead in any sphere of life, 
Consistency is the major ingredient. You cannot stop on the way and expect to reach the destination.
Do not look at the final goal each time and worry about not making enough progress.
Your only concern is making daily progress, improve your learning methodology.
Learn, unlearn and re-learn habits to acheive top performance. 

Setup a counter, where you can measure the progress.
Every great invention was started by a spark of an idea and constant grind over years to make the spark a great inferno.
As long as you tend to the fire, you can make progress. Do not let the fire flicker away, feed the fire each day.
The greatest product in the world you need to build, is yourself. Do not forget about yourself. Do not lose your dreams in the hurricane.

Writing has become consistent, code is not making the necessary progress. 
Time to build the consistency with software. To go to Mars, we need to build our own Habitat. 
Start with ISS simulation and you will make the system that will bring your ticket to Mars.
