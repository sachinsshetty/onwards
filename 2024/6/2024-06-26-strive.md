Strive 

Strive now when you have the energy,  resource to use and opportunities to build a strong future. 
If you miss the mark again, like all the times before, your daily life will become a worse nightmare than the demons that you face daily.

Let go of all expectations,  shutdown the castles of glass grown as a dream. You only have yourself at each state of life,  others can only provide a lift , they can't carry your weight.  Don't bring your problems to others,  you should and can solve the problems in life.  

No waiting for others. 
Building myself one day at a time.  The step to Mars,  will  be the leading light to the future.
Will not be forever in the pits. I will be fury like a phoenix and climb up back again.

The waves keep coming hard in the rocky bay, without a light tower guiding the present. You will be thrown around if your dont fight with all your might.
