Build

The benefit of building the product that you want to use,
make's the path easier to experiment.
You do not have to optimise for a future idea or business.
As long as the narrow path of usage works reliably, the work you do become easy.

Building small functions everyday, is the path forward. 
As long as you keep progressing, the goal get closer to accomplish.

We overestimate what we can accomplish in a month, but underestimate what we could accmomplish in a year,

Speech to Speech Inference is possble with existing Open source software and techniques.

You just need to connect the dots, by traversing the paths and find the best nodes in the graph to connect.

The future path to Mars, seems possible with a clear components to integrate. Nobody will help you get to Mars.
You need to create your own vehicle to reach there, each day make the parts of the vehicle reliable.

We will get to Mars, first with an idea, then a simulation, then an MVP on Earth and finally tech demo on Mars.
