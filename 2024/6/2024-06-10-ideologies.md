Ideologies

When your dreams are not being pursued dramatically, you'll get sidestepped by other ideologies .

You should aim to fulfill your dreams into real goals,  so that you won't be making another person's dreams. 

Don't exist just to exist.  You have time each day,  to work for sustenance of life and time to sustain your dreams.  Both can co- exist if you actively make efforts. 

Reflect on the ideas and future you dreamt as a kid.  What you could not afford back then,  can now be accomplished with proper plans. You may not have been born wealthy,  but if you have survived youth without health issue, then surely you can pick yourself up wherever you are situated. Focus and perseverance are the only two ingredients for making impossible ideas into work prototype and to flourishing products .

Don't get caught into the politics of the day.  Many things can be solved with ingenious solutions at the small scale. First solve the problem, then only think of ideologies.
