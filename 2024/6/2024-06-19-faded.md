Faded

We are fading away in the giant chaos dismantling anything anytime. A moment of losing focus and the world starts to come crashing down. You all always need to keep your guard up against any force. 

Today we're down in the mess, the force of entropy crushing us and keeping us down.
Momentum is the only active defense against the chaos. 

Every era involves building defense and making strong fortifications.  We lost the last era's,  we should start making the defenses now, everything is not lost completely yet, there is still a way to wage a battle in this era and become stronger for the next stage. Focus on the top goal, dont be lost every single night.  Dismantle the bad habits, there is aa way, we will find it and make the way into a highway to our dreams.
