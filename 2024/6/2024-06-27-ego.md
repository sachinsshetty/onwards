Ego

Do you swallow your ego and start to work on yourself with humility or

Do you plan to showcase your wealth/attitiude on the persons who have helped you in your journey.

What kind of a person do you want to become ?
will people want to collaborate with you or do people shirk away in your presence and when your name is highlighted.

What do you project yourself as ?
What do you see yourself as, in the mirror ? Every day ?

Dont't Yap

Silence is OK, you dont have to keep talking nonstop
Dont keep reminiscing the past. Just let the conversation drift away.

Nobody is interested in your past history. Its not a thrilling adventure to listen. 
Insted of talk, acceptance of silence and focus on goal should be practivce.
Embrace solitude, quieten the mind. Let it stay in one place. 
Use breathing and yogasana to help understand the mind
