Hackathon- June 29-30 , Munich 



Experiments with drone api and processing the image into insights. 

Stayed overnight at the venue, first time all nighter in life trying to solve a problem.

Next should learn to build tracking algorithm and parallel processing of data for Images. Learn how maps are created,

Pitch 

Dual Use- Habitat maintenance- find plant growth in remote ares 

Inspiration- Age of Empire- knight: removes the fog of war by moving fast across the regions and sening the image back. 


Current status -

Drone communication via Wifi 
Dara processing on server  


Simple Drone path planning for reconnaissance 


Modules are plug and play.
Open source code  and Open weight models. 


Additonal sensor suite and pass the information to llm engine analyser 


Needs a GPU for low latency, possible to Run it on CPU for batch processing and history / timeline building. 


Maps can be updated by a swarm of reconaissance drones. Each are independent and can receive updated information.

Steppe 

Make reconaissance the next priority project. 

Trail with dji drone to create digital drone. 
Low cost, safe for Autonomous movements.  5mp camera enough to provide good input data. 
10 min life enough to make passes inside a warehouse.  Swarm of drones can build a real time map, by stitching small map into a larger map.

Each day, improve the code, function by function. The small steps are absolutely the way forward to make an instant success .
