Future

The future should look like the future.
The ideas and plans of visionary leaders gives exciting hope for the future.
You can envision your role into creating a magical experience with the hold.
Think long and hard about what you want to work in the next 3 months and 1 years.
Every single day is an important march of time. March past the uncertainties of life.
Do not let anything come between your goals/aims, run, run, run.
Blaze past obstacles and let low impact items pass by without holding you hostage. 
The past cannot be changed, you can surely re-build the future again
