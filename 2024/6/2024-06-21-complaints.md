stop complaining

When your under pressure,  stop complaining about the problems and difficulties every day.
Instead, reduce expectations and promises to match the current energy and resources. 

Think through the problems and set a new baseline for your deliveries. When taking on new projects, provide ample time for experiments. 

The world will not collapse immediately,  if there are delays due to unexpected problems and missed projections. Get the thing done with whatever tools you can get your hands on.

You need to make your time valuable by not spending with distractions. 

You proclaimed that you will go to Mars, with high ambitions you should have thick skin for failures and strong energy to complete tasks. Do more, talk less. Learn deeply, build prototype every day.
