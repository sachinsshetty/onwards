Down 

I get knocked down, but I get up again
You are never gonna keep me down 

I get knocked down, but I get up again
You are never gonna keep me down 

I get knocked down, but I get up again
You are never gonna keep me down

Standards and high expectations for self,
Understanding, empathy and teaching for others.
