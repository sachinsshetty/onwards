Repeat

You cannot change the world,
But you can definitely change your own small world and expand it. Begin with whatever you have and wherever you are.

Each day repeat your best actions, do the most demanding and important work first.  You can catch up with the world when your forced to idle. 
Setup time windows, so that you are not falling behind on the best progress in life. 

You cannot go back 15 years to restart life again, but you can consider today as the starting point for a restart you wish you did 15 years later. Today is a great gift, keep learning, keep experimenting. 

Have a cause to fight for, your work ethic should shine brilliantly for your aims to complete. Do not just day dream, go get it.

Think, Execute, Think, Execute. Repeat.

When your making progress on your life goals, you tend not to become triggered with the activities of the world. You know internally, how you would bring across change in this world. Continue the pursuit of knowledge creation.
