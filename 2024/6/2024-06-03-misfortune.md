Self organizing systems

Misfortune will not come with a prior warning. You cannot control external variables in a system,  but you can build fail-safe so that your own world does not shatter .

Understand the world and build a guide to navigate the different problems and traps.

Make a baseline for your strength and failures.  Do not ever let yourself feel bad about this life.
Its only a bad phase, you had good phases too.

Dont let being a victim of circumstance as the defining personality,  fight against the oppression of light. Hit back with all your might when you've been hit,  get up again when you've been knocked down flat. You cannot stay down anymore than a day. Find solutions for the problems life throws at you, side step the fights that doesn't need your energy. 

Help others grow and overcome problems. Show the light to the world in the times of darkness,  the world is always in a state of chaos,  find and create your island of peace.

Destiny

The child awakes the fate, that he is destined for by the Daily inroads and efforts to make the dream into reality.

Many times we drop the ball and leave the path that we chose to pursue. The path ahead will have a lot of diversions,  this is the way of the world. Its not actively trying to sabotage your progress,  life gives a lot of options, stay awake and active to choose the right paths. 

Keep your health in order and in mint condition, because the pursuit of Mars is a long marathon.  You have to build and use enormous energy to run a robot on Mars. 

Pursue the hardest problem and tackle it with the
smallest tasks to finish every day. As long as you keep pushing in the same direction without giving up,  the outcomes will change drastically into good fortune due to compound interest.
