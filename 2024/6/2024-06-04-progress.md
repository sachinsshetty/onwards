Progress

Keep faith in your progress, 
A winner needs to fight and overcome a thousand battles each day to reach the top spot.
Every day put one step ahead, its going to be hard today.
But we are progressing compared to the terrors of 2020-22. 

Do what you can, bet on the toughest problems. Risk your future to the things never done before.
You are more valuable, if you are skilled in knowledge which is at the cutting edge of space and technology.

There is no tomorrow, do what you can today. 
This day, we will go further than we ever did. 

Many times we go wrong by measuring the progress done in the last few days or weeks.
Lasting change will come with consistent months of improving one's habits.
Measure how you grew in the last year, last 5 years and last decade. 

You would have grown into an all round person, when you identified some skill that was lacking. 
Work on the best attribute of yourself and keep improving, share your knowledge so that you can fall back on information.

This life is impressive, even with the failures and setbacks. Beat the decay of entropy.
