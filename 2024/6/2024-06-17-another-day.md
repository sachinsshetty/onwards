Another day

Live to fight another day.
If its too difficult,  take a small rest/break and begin again.
Dont give up after coming so far, life's journey is not only about collecting prizes.  
Each phase has a lesson to be understood and learnt. if you missed to learn it,  be sure of the problem coming back to teach you once more.

The days will be difficult,  the weeks will incur problems, the months become depressive and the years make a tragedy. Survive them all,  longevity trumps all disasters. Good years and bad years will average out the misery,  live a simple long life. 
Your life is a constant celebration and mourning. Nothing is permanent, pick up the pieces wherever you are. Build again, build today.  Dont let the shackles of yesterday stop you from flying free and high into the future.
