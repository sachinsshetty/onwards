Starfactory 

I see the factory and my problems dissipate. 
Inspiration is high to think big and have an enormous goal .

Don't lose your sight on small and petty issues.
Dedicate your existence to untangling the secrets of life and the cosmos.
We are the alive today, no other day and era is better than the opportunities available today. Think hard , think long about what you want to your life to look like in 10 years. What progress would you wish to complete in the timeframe.
