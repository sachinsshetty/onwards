2 Year Redemption

Been 2 years since the start of Redemption journey. June 15 2022 started the new age of existence.
Finally breaking throught the shackles of Covid and get back to improving life.

From the despair of hunger, poverty and homelessness, life has improved with the better application of one's time.
Making new things, than being just a dumb consumer has modified trajectory of life.

Some issues still persis, but these can be fixed. Its only a matter of time, going to actively pursue the problems/issue to see them to conclusion.

Redemption journey begins Year 3. This year, we will work harder than ever before. Become a dedicated individual and pursue greatness in all spheres of life.
