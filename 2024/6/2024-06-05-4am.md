4 am Club

5th june - day starts at the first glimpse of light.
All the senses are in top shape focussing on important task. The best wake up early to conquer goals.

We will start our day in silence, moving dirt eveyday to eventually move the mountain. Think hard and wise about the life you want in 1 year, 3 years and 10 years. What you do today will go a long way , each day start strong. Finish what you planned and more for the day. Do not postpone any item, we do not slow the march of space exploration , we accelerate each day for a fantastic future. 


Fight against the dying of the light.
Fight for your dreams and goals.
