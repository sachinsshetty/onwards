Abstinence of Life 

Some stages of life are just not made for everyone.  Many people in the world are hit by tragedy at uncertain times. 

You have to sacrifice the stage in life,  which has the highest dependency on others.  Stop creating day dreams of a rosy future in the aspect of dependency.  

Many great discoveries have been credited to the people who sacrificed the unknown dependency.  It's the price you have to pay to become Immortal atleast for a few decades.  

You gain in life for the future goals, so do not despair,  instead utilize it as a great opportunity to build the dimension of life.  

Carve out the future with Supreme confidence in your abilities, which you hone each day at the altar of excellence. 

Deal with whatever cards you've been dealt,  do not waste time expecting a better hand. You cannot change external factors,  change your internal world.  Its possible to build again , strive extreme hard,  leave nothing to chance.  Everything needs to be done by yourself.
