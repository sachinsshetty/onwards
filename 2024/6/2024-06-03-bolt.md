Bolt out of the blue

Past mistakes come to bite you hard, if you ignore it,
the wound festers and you will have to cut off a lifeline.
When everything is going well, you consider the past choices are correct.
The moment you face a setback, you consider the same choices as a mistake.
Dont delve on the past mistake & increase the time of doom loop. Snap out of it,
How will you avoid repeat of past problems. List all the items that you are avoiding/postponing
consciosly and unconsciosuly. Fix them immediately or at the very least make a documented schedule to tackle it.
Do not let yourself constantly hit by problems.
