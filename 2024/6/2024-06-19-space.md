Space 

Work space is bigger than rest space. 
More space to breathe at work than place at home.

You have to choose something and live with it, Optimise for better experiments than sleeping arrangements. 
Save whenever you can, build up your internal energy with good exercise and nutrition. 
Dont lose out on making amazing work for lack of necessary energy. 

The journey to mars will be in cramped spaces, make yourself lean and strong to withstand forces of earth gravity at launch, zero gravity during coast phase and hard braking during entry and landing. 

Build your space with tools necessary to survive and sustain the long periods on Mars and the training periods on the Moon and Antarctica. Maintain your daily regimen, become a top physical specimen. Notice every bite that you consume for body, mind and soul. Handle  corrosive elements with extreme care.

Get strong, physically,  financially and mentally. 
We will take every shot now to reach the cosmos.
