Thinking

You want to be able to think for yourself.
You want to be able to schedule your day and months and years ahead based 
on plans that you thought over a period of time.

You need to have a vision of the future. So that you continously put forward everday steps towards it.
Without a future vision, you will reach someplace unknown, clutching at straws again,
because you did not let your mind guide you here and you were just blown past to the current predicament.

Thinking gives you the opportunity to plan and improvise based on current factors. Your direction wont change 90/180
degress making you to forego plans, but you change direction by a few degress to navigate the current choppy waters.

Are you now at the place where you dreamt, desired and planned to be ? Is you current life matching your most recent plans.
Take a blood oath to re-formulate your life into the current best plan. 
Live each day according to the plan, dont falter, for 365 daus follow the scheme 100%. Your life can be transformed into
your dream plan with 365 days of practice. Each day lived well will get you to your dreams.

Think and write, read again, improvise the draft. Implement the priority item, then keep updating the parameter to reach the best outcome.
