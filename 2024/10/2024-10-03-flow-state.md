Flow State

When you are in pursuit of a solution,
You keep pushing for the answer. The mind and body get into the state
of a master creating his masterpiece.

A habit is formed to do important work with priority. 
All other matter's can be discarded without any lingering issues.
There is a resistance on the beginning against pursuing mastery.
It eventually becomes the strength against other distracting activities.

We've now discovered this state of flow building out the ideas behind gaganyatri.
Part by part we are creating the Rocketship to Mars.
A new version has to be rebuilt and the process updated. 
Our timer has been set to 2 years countdown until the next Mars transfer.
Our product should be tested and launched at the earliest.

Strengthen your product to the SOTA(state of the art). You have to design, build, test
and iterate a million times. Vaccum is unforgiving, it does not allow any discrepancies.
Entire structure is evaluated in milli-seconds and pushed to the limits.
All plans will be battle-tested at the first contact.

No, stopping back now from building out the Humanoid, to work on Mars in place
of the first Human's arrival after a few years. All systems and sensors will be used 
and verified to work with precision, safety and efficiently. The path to Mars
need laser focus on the target.

Embrace the flow state, get things moving. We are made of stardust.
We have become the apex predator on Earh. We will now tame the harsh environment on Mars
with ingenuity, discipline and long-term execution.
