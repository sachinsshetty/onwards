Write code with whatever time you get. 

Every breathing moment improve the features ,

Take your Roadmap to heart,  let it be the only guiding light.  Dont be distracted with false promises,  dont wait for anyone. 
When your at the hatch,  stepping into the vacuum of space.  It comes down to you and your habits. Life and death measured in milli seconds.
