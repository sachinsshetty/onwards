Sit with Silence 

Can you sit on a chair for 30 mind and not do anything.
Learn to empty your mind from following many outcomes of future.

The practice of Journaling and scheduling your days and week ahead, 
free's the mind of keeping 100 of items at
all times, leading to loss of memory and compute.

You can delegate the tasks to the future 
or cancel them if they are not of critical value and of high priority. 
You will get the calmness of mind, knowing that you've tracked all the important work on a physical paper.
No major task is lost to the abyss of the mind.

Cultivate the power to sit still. You can outlast any problems with a clear mind.
