Broken Heart Syndrome 



I wished for a little care and affection too.
It seems that my actions don't make any difference and I'm being tolerated as a temporary nuisance.  Before it becomes a headache to you,  I'll just step back.

Can't hurt my heart anymore.  It has waited for love for a long time.  It has become cold again,  without receiving love and warmth. It gave all the love and warmth one could possibly give.  

We could've tried to be happy together , rather than being miserable alone. It is not meant to be easy in this lifetime.  Love is not what one can get in return, with everything that one could give in return. 

Its time to move on in life.
