Goodbye, sunshine 

With the turmoil of the world around,
Do not want to pull another soul into the current trial, better to smile from a distance. 

With a mountain of debts riding on my tail and threatening avalanche of debts from family . This life is disaster to all those who might come into the shadow of this life existence.  

Abandon all hope for a smooth sailing ,
Fight for today and tomorrow, don't make dreams with another person, it will crumble into a thousand pieces. 

Make a resolve to never feel this way again.
You cannot expect someone else for anything, 
You come alone and leave alone. Become strong, dont become clinging. 

We are beasts of the nature, the apex predator of the earth. Dont falter like a deer encircled by hunting lions. 
You want to be the best in the whole wide world, 
Only the the best will get a chance of the century for Mars . Let go, let go of everything. 

This is the way. Live and let live
