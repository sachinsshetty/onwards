Work to Retire Parents

Work hard and make enough money to retire your parents.

Dont lose patience and speak harsh words with family.

Take the time to get them healthy, there is no point in fighting over small issues. 

We have to live with family who helped us grow into better human beings.

They've sacrificed many things in their own life to give us a better tomorrow. 

100s of times we have been lifted up when we were down and hurt. Time to become empathetic  and hold their hands to steady them in old age. 

Start to work hard and steady the finances,  any person can lift their lives in 3 months of Pure effort .

Work so hard, that you can make parents retire early. You are now the man of the house.

Start acting responsibly, take on the work that was done parents. Increase the items on your plate by moving from their activities to your action items.
