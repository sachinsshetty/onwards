Dear Sunshine 

It's been a long time since we last met.
Heart skipped a lot of beats when I found you  among the crowd.
Watching the sunshine, after looking only at Photos made the heart warm. 
Stress and weight on the shoulder lifted immediately when we met and I could sense my heart flutter when we held hands. 

The shine in your eyes, made me lose myself for a while. 

 Once a while. 
A little bird has to whisper sweetly in your eyes,
 How special and wonderful you are.
You are the muse for my writing,  makes the words come strongly with affection and love. 
Please know that you are special to many people,  wish you all the love and happiness of the world. 

You should know that you are loved by many people including friends and family. 
Each of us,  show our love and care in different ways. 
We are very happy to have you as part of our life. 

The words are straight from the heart without filter,
I will find new ways to show my love and care for you. 
Life is better when we have someone who is there beside as support, we have our different goals to purse independently , for many things it's great to have someone we care and love.
