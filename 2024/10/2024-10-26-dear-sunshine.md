Dear Sunshine 

It's been a long time since we last met.
Heart skipped a lot of beats when I found you  among the crowd.
Watching the sunshine, after looking only at Photos made the heart warm. 
Stress and weight on the shoulder lifted immediately when we met and I could sense my heart flutter when we held hands. 

The shine in your eyes, made me lose myself for a while.
