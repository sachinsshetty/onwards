October 2024 - Life Update

At home in Hubli, to tie up a few loose ends.
Many things needed a bit of upkeep which required my presence/skills
and a lending hand to get things done in the household.

My own health needs fixing, Dental issue's will recur in the Wurzburg/Bavarian winter.
Have to fix everything before i need to travel back.

Finance is another monsterous avalanche waiting to make its kill again and respawn with increased debts.
It has taken me and family down many times already. Mountain's of debt have been up piling up exponentially.
I need to get a hold of my spending since my expected income will be stagnant for a year.
Only by selling a product will there be any change income and reduce the debts marginally. 
One large amount is needed to take a chunk out of the debts. Have to keep building the product,
its the only way to get it.

There are a few ideas that i would like to pursue. I believe i should make more time to explore them
atleast at the surface for financial viability.

First, Space Research and Operations tools.
Second, Humanoid Robots for household/Mars habitat
Third, Generative AI tools for Speech and Video Analysis
