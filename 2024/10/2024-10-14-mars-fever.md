Mars Fever - October 2024

Watching the MechaZilla chopsticks catch Super Heavy on Flight 5
brought immeasuravle happiness and tears of joy. 
Falcon 9 made landing sub-orbital landing routine with Drone ships and RTLS(return to landing site). Now we will make Starship launch, catch, relaunch as simple routine.

My dreams for Mars has got a large fuel boost. Am i dreaming big enough. 
Dreams should look impossible in the beginning. As long as you keep working 
at the highest levels of delivery each day, the dream will arrive.
Maybe a bit late, better late than never.

Humans should travel into the cosmos, we will not be held back on Earth.
Moon has been stepped on, Mars is the frontier for my Generation.
