Empathy - Apathy

From apathy to everyone due to depression settling in a few years ago.
Slowly empathy is returning, making me a human again.

Apathy had drowned away all emotions. Nothing mattered, as long as I got what I wanted for the moment.
Self preservation had disappeared. One had gone into a deep dark shell, severing all contact with the outside world.

At this point of life. One wished that world would end, so that there were would be no memory of misery.

Time has changed, the past memory is a lesson for the future to avoid falling down.
Now the future holds promise and we wish that the world stays as it is.

Learn to live with others, dont push others into pain and suffering.
The world needs constant healing, if you cannot do any good, do not create bad stuff.
