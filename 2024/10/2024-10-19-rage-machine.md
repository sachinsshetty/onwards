Rage, the Machine

Rage against the dying light.
Rage against the fading hope.
Rage against invisible walls holding back life 
Rage against unseen misery inflicted by hurt souls.
Rage against blockers built by status quo. 


Become the Machine that moves the world. 
Build the infinite energy machine, to uplift the world of never ending misery from no energy.

This world accommodates everyone,  you can build the machine of dreams with progress everyday or you can dream everyday of building machines. Both is possible,  both has been done forever.
