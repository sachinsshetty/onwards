Weakness 

Day has not started well now,  with minor fluctuations in body health slowing down work.

There is a fog in the brain, with no energy left in the muscles and body sagging a bit in lethargy.

One needs to build stamina in good health to have energy left in bad health. 

This energy loss brings back memories of the Slum mode back in 2020-22.
