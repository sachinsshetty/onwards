Future Promise

Time is slipping fast between fingers, when I am desperately trying to hold 
it closer for life's few milestones.
The milestones are far away again, not getting any closer.
Step back one moment, look where your trajectory is now pointing to.

Re-organise your life again, dont get comfortable with the current safe Home environment.
You'll move out again soon. Rather start doing the activites from now itself. You cannot
afford to lose any more days.

Schedule your priority work to the top and first action of the day.
Build your natural immunity with exercises and running. You cannot fall ill
with a little extra strain on the muscles. Dont lose entire days with bad health.

You need to preserve your body as temple, keep it in immaculate condition.
This is the only asset that cannot be replaced and repaired with new parts.
Any damage is final and life lasting, take stock of your health and improve it each day.
There is no silver tablet to fix all problems immediately, but it can definitely be 
improved every day with simple tasks. Small good things will add up nicely into a life long good health.

Today and future, will come to pass. Its better to have travelled in the direction of one's choice
rather than buffeted by the vagaries of life.
Take control of each minute and hour, Your life will change into the design that you made.
Make precise design for today and future. The promise of better future is accomplished with today's effort done right.
