Starship March 2024 Update

Living on mars is becoming real with an accelerated pace. 
What was science fiction and imagination over the last few centuries is being made into real life transport by the pioneers of the current generation. 

Our own contribution will be in the form of Autonomous Greenhouse Habitat. 

Software based simulation should be completed within the next month. Build detailed plans for each module, first by hand and then verify the design using LLM models.

With our current workplace, there is opportunity to collaborate with Electric and Mechanical engineers to build small scale prototype and get help with design and validation.
