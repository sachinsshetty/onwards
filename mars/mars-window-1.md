Mars Window

Opportunity exists every 18-24 months.
- 2024 - October
- 2026 - November

We missed 2024 window for any satellites or software for the available window.

We will consider the October,2024 to November,2026 duration as rocket travel for our own missions.
As a hypothetical scenario, consider that you have launched the Escapade satellites, how will track and mesaure telemetry.

Build a orbit visualizer which provides current info about the satellite.
What is the location, how are its components working.
What LEOP operations had to be completed. We have all mission parameters. Use the knowledge from QUBE operations.
Create your own Open Source Operations, which provides live information for the simulation.

By next window, your work should be present in a Mars satellite or rover.
