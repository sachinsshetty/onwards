- Communication
  - Current
    - Orbiter
	- China
	- India
	- USA
  - Future
    - Starlink
  - Current version needs specific hardware to communicate to Erath. It is cost-prohibitive for large scale communication and long term use.
We have to use them in the short term to establish basic communication.
Use the bandwidth to send consolidated data and error diagnostics.
  - Future
    - Starlink can deployed to cover the different habitable rehions. 
    - Calculation has to be done on how maany satellites would be required at the minimun to support the habitats.

- Food Generation
  - Current
    - NASA missions, Internation space stations
    - Anatarctica Habitats
    - Glass - Greenhouse
  - Future Automated Greenhouse
    - A series of shipping container's which are densely packed with seeds, water generation equipment, soil and robots.
    - On landing, based on guided parachute landing with control thursters. Robots will become active.
    - Robots will unpack the hardware, and build the setup for autonomous greenhouse
    - We can demonstrate the usability in deserts and antarctica for fool-proof verfication.
