YC  - Work at a startup

- Describe yourself in a short phrase. e.g. "Machine learning engineer from Twitter", "Recent CS college grad who interned two summers at startups", "DevOps engineer who scaled a site to 10M+ users", "Frontend developer specializing in mobile interfaces" *

- What are you looking for in your next role? What would you like to avoid? (Might include aspects like technologies you want to work with, industries you’re interested in, team dynamics, software development practices … whatever is important to you) *

- Optionally, describe a project that you worked on that you are proud of. It's best if you can describe it from start to finish including the motivation and technical details. If you are describing a team effort, please be specific about your personal contribution.
