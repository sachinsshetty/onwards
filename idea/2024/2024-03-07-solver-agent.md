Solver Agent - Work with AI

Sandboxed arena.
Two agents talk to each other and solves problems. 

Trained on GitHub/ GitlLab error and stack trace. 

Based on problem complexity,  awitch between models of different quantization. 

Improve efficiency of existing software stack.
Provide doc strings for examples, Optimise complex functions into small problems.

Reduce dependency tree,  rwrite smaller functions after validation with existing library.

A. Provide patches for libraries to fix owasp errors,  
Automate verification of bugs and check for known issues.


B. Summarize papers and run the algorithm provided.  Create code based on paper idea and implementation.  Validate the benchmarks and comparioson .
Open Source. 

C. Work with tinygrad/ 

-
Super charge software creations with Solver. 
From simple idea to code creation.

Create solution for Algorithm book.
Build examples in all languages.
