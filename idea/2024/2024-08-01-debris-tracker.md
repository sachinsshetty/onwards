Onboard Debris Tracker with ground system validation 

Validation of Debris tracking using knowledge from ground radar system.


Based on ground radar system, satellite will receive command/info of nearby debris.

Satellite will start the payload for debris tracker.


On board camera will take photo,
Process the image via  on board compute,
It will validate the real time position of debris, by matching the coordinates with time/gps.

Ground system will receive the delta, if any shift is observed and update the system accordingly.
Size/shape of the debris is updated to verify the structure in the database.
