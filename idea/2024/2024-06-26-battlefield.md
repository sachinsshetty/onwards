2Digital Battlefield 

Build a Digital Battlefield with a game engine for battle simulation 
using UI like Age of Empire/Civilization to showcase strategy and troop utilization. 

 Use realtime sensor data to feed the Autonomous agents with data to update their commands. 
With vision recognition model provide routes on new terrains. 

Looking for interested teammates. 
I code with python and have basic experience to prototype with LLM, zero experience with sensor integration
