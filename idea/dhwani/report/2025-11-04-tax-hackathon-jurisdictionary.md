We won the Tax Tech Hackathon 2025, conducted alongside Tax Tech Conference, Frankfurt. 

Our prototype - Juris-Diction(AI)ry powered by dwani.ai Discovery explores e-invoicing  compliance for EU. 

Prototype included Document analytics with PDF/XML file extraction for regulation compliance. 

The dashboard also supprted Text-To-SQL to chat with any tables/UI, with AI generating SQL and executing in SQLite for multiple tables and final analyis based on the user request.

We used Qwen-3-VL with GH200 on lambda.ai and L4 GPU on GCP cloud for 
1. Document Extraction  with VLM
2. Text-To-SQL using tool_call
3. Structured Json for analysis
