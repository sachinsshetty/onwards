Hi,

We provided dwani.ai inference API to Srishti Hackathon 2025 in Bengaluru from 23-25 May.

110 teams / 400+ participants took part in the competition. 

We saw over 100 unique solutions in Healthcare and Public Governance improvement with AI integrated for Indian languages.

Our inference API were running on 10 x Nvidia GH200 GPU's at Lambda Labs.

We released python-sdk for dwani.ai and received feedback to improve over the next days.

Internally we migrated our system to run on Nvidia H200 GPU and are upgrading our tools to run with arm64 architecture. 

Looking forward to your continued support.
