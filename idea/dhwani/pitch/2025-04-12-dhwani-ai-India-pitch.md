  - Set colors: Saffron (#FF9933), Green (#138808), Purple (#6A1B9A).
  - Import Poppins font, create logo placeholder (“Dhwani” in purple).
- **Step 2: Slide Design** (2-3 days):
  - Create 8 slides per layouts above.
  - Source images (Unsplash/Pexels, 3-4 total).
  - Add icons (Flaticon, 6-8 total, free pack).
  - Design pie chart (Slide 6) and stat box (Slide 5) in Canva.
- **Step 3: Logo** (1 day):
  - Use Canva Logo Maker: Combine microphone + “ಧ್ವನಿ” (Noto Sans Kannada).
  - Export as PNG (transparent, 200px).
  - Alternative: Hire Fiverr designer (€20-50).
- **Step 4: Review** (1 day):

  - Test contrast (e.g., WebAIM Contrast Checker).
  - Practice timing (~35 seconds/slide).
- **Total Timeline**: 5-6 days.
- **Budget**: €0 (DIY with Canva) or €150-300 (designer for logo/slides).

---

## Additional Tips
- **Consistency**:
  - Use same logo size (~40-50px) across slides.
  - Apply gradient (saffron-purple or green-white) to 4-5 slides, solid gray to 3 for variety.
  - Align all text/icons to a 12px grid for polish.
- **Cultural Resonance**:
  - Add jasmine flower (small, 10px) in 2-3 slide corners (Karnataka symbol).
  - Use Kannada script sparingly (e.g., logo, Slide 7 icon) to avoid clutter.
- **Testing**:
  - Preview on projector/phone to ensure colors pop.
  - Share with 1-2 peers for feedback on “inspiration” (non-black-and-white goal).
- **Fallbacks**:
  - If image sourcing is slow, use Canva’s stock photos (filter: “India”).
  - If logo delays, stick with text-based “Dhwani” (still effective).
- **Q&A Support**:
  - Create 1-page handout (Canva) with appendix (financials: €7500/month, team: Sachin’s bio).
  - Include QR code to Play Store in Slide 8 or handout.
