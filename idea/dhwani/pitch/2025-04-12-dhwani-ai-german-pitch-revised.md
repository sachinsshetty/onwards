# Dhwani Pitch Deck (Revised)

This document outlines the revised pitch deck for Dhwani, a German-speaking voice assistant, incorporating feedback to enhance storytelling, ensure German language focus, and improve design consistency. The structure maintains the original factual strengths while addressing emotional appeal, visual coherence, and German-centric content.

---

## General Design Recommendations
- **Visual Theme**: Use a clean, modern design with a color palette of blues, whites, and subtle German cultural accents (e.g., yellow or black from the German flag). Fonts: Montserrat or Open Sans for readability.
- **German Focus**: All screenshots, demos, and text examples must feature German to align with the 50M+ German-speaking audience. Avoid unrelated languages (e.g., Indian languages like Kannada) unless showing scalability.
- **Visual Storytelling**: Incorporate icons, infographics, and images evoking accessibility, privacy, and German culture (e.g., diverse users, privacy locks, subtle German landmarks).
- **Slide Layout**: One key message per slide, supported by visuals and minimal text. Use animations sparingly to guide attention.
