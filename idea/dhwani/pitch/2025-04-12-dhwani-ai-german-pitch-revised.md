# Dhwani Pitch Deck (Revised)

This document outlines the revised pitch deck for Dhwani, a German-speaking voice assistant, incorporating feedback to enhance storytelling, ensure German language focus, and improve design consistency. The structure maintains the original factual strengths while addressing emotional appeal, visual coherence, and German-centric content.

---

## General Design Recommendations
- **Visual Theme**: Use a clean, modern design with a color palette of blues, whites, and subtle German cultural accents (e.g., yellow or black from the German flag). Fonts: Montserrat or Open Sans for readability.
- **German Focus**: All screenshots, demos, and text examples must feature German to align with the 50M+ German-speaking audience. Avoid unrelated languages (e.g., Indian languages like Kannada) unless showing scalability.
- **Visual Storytelling**: Incorporate icons, infographics, and images evoking accessibility, privacy, and German culture (e.g., diverse users, privacy locks, subtle German landmarks).
- **Slide Layout**: One key message per slide, supported by visuals and minimal text. Use animations sparingly to guide attention.

## Implementation Tips
- **Tools**:
  - **Canva**: Use pitch deck template, customize with German imagery (“Germany culture”, “accessibility tech”). Add icons from library.
  - **Figma**: Create 8px grid, import Unsplash photos (“German people”, “Berlin skyline”), use map plugins.
  - **PowerPoint**: Apply premium template, source Shutterstock/Pexels images, use fade transitions.
- **German Text**: Demo phrases: “Wie ist das Wetter?”, “Lies mir die Nachrichten”, “Übersetze ins Englische”. Verify dialects (e.g., Bavarian vs. Standard).
- **Stock Images**: Unsplash/Pexels for “German elderly”, “Berlin students”, “accessibility tech”. Avoid clichéd tech imagery.
- **Map Creation**: Snazzy Maps or Canva elements for market slide, highlighting German-speaking regions.
- **Consistency**: Save master slide with palette, fonts, logo placement. Export as PDF/PPTX.

---

## Notes
- **Feedback Alignment**: Slides use German text only (no Indian languages), feature Anna’s story (Slides 2, 16), and incorporate cultural cues (flag, cityscapes).
- **Scope**: Covers Slides 1, 2, 5, 8, 16 to demonstrate style. Other slides (e.g., Financials) can use similar elements (pie charts, timelines with German icons).
- **Limitations**: Descriptions maximize detail without image generation. For wireframes or additional slides, please specify.
- **Next Steps**: Brief a designer with these details or create slides in chosen tool. Can refine further (e.g., hex codes, German phrases).
