Fix My City : dwani 

A Civilian App to identify and report problems.

dwani was started to provide Voice AI in Indian languages.  Open source development and AI skills workshop for students has been the core mission.

With the advancement of Vision AI, we can now utilize AI to improve Civics and upgrade our surroundings. 

dwani Android app will add a new feature where users can upload photos along with GPS tags to identify/report issues about your locality/city .

We will further collaborate with Government authorities to resolve the features and provide information about issues. 

Using OpenStreetMap all issues will be public and users can track the changes over time. 

Two POC was done over the last month,  
WeaponWatch  - to report dangerous items in war/conflict areas and GardenWatchAI - to analyse gardens/parks and get detailed steps to  fix the place with garden tools .


The features will be gradually added to improve the effectiveness of the system. 

Initial pilot will be available for Hubballi and Bengaluru. 

The project is Open Source with MIT license and can be taken up by enthusiasts to support their own cities.
