Why dwani


Because it should exist. 

There should be an alternate way to get knowledge,  without being dependent on external sources. 


You should be able to run it, anywhere and anytime. 

Download all the software on a 64/128 GB pen drive, 
It should be run forever, as long as computers exists. 


Think long term, exexute week to week.
Make constant progress each day, like a brick layer build the great KRS dam in Mysore.

We are destined to do great things, dont let failures stop you from doing the hard work.
There are no shortcuts, do everything necessary and possible to keep dwani alive.

We need to cross the next phase of critical mass, use all the past knowledge.  Learn new ways of making it work, it's been done before. 
We will do it , again and again.
