Dhwani AI - Request for Grants

1. GPU credits (Huggingface Preferred)-  3-6 months of L4 /L40S GPU compute to run Dhwani API server

Below is the 3 month roadmap for Dhwani AI to improve accessibility.
1. Education - https://github.com/sachinsshetty/onwards/blob/main/idea/dhwani/pitch/2025-04-02-dhwani-education-roadmap.md
2. Business - https://github.com/sachinsshetty/onwards/blob/main/idea/dhwani/pitch/2025-04-02-dhwani-april-business-roadmap.md

With access to GPU credits, we will be able to make the API accessible to students and collaborate with more universities.

Dhwani AI USP is Kannada Voice Chat for tier 2/tier3 cities for users and
 ability to self-host the systems for enterprise/university/students 

Once Dhwani AI has full feature-set to make End to End Speech for Kannada,
we will restart work on Sanjeevi - Medical Transcription System
