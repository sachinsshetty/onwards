Grit & Motivation
Whatâ€™s the hardest thing you have overcome? What did you learn about yourself? This could be professional or personal.

Identifying that ideas not pursued is a failure,  Had prototyped multiple products over the years, but did not take it further.  Android apps in 2012,  RFID for toll-gates in 2015.  Drones for Solar panel cleaning in 2018.  Now dwani.ai is an idea that i am giving it all,  bootstrapping it and scraping every cent to make it work.   with or without investment will make it reach 700M users
