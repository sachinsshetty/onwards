# Dhwani Presentation Visuals for Undergraduate Students

This document provides a detailed guide to create engaging visuals for the "Dhwani - Voice AI" presentation, designed for an undergraduate audience. These visuals align with the revised slides from the previous Markdown file, enhancing relatability and clarity for Kannada-speaking students.

## How to Create These Visuals

1. **Choose a Tool**:
   - **Canva**: Free, drag-and-drop interface; ideal for beginners. Sign up at [canva.com](https://www.canva.com), select “Presentation (16:9),” and use templates or custom designs.
   - **PowerPoint/Google Slides**: Familiar to most students; great for quick edits and built-in icons.
2. **Gather Assets**:
   - **Images**: Search [Unsplash](https://unsplash.com) or [Pexels](https://pexels.com) for “students,” “smartphones,” or “Karnataka culture.”
   - **Icons**: [Freepik](https://freepik.com) or Canva’s free library (e.g., microphones, speech bubbles).
   - **Logos**: Use official GitHub, HuggingFace, or IIT Madras logos (with permission if public-facing).
3. **Add Kannada Text**:
   - Use [Google Input Tools](https://www.google.com/inputtools) to type Kannada, then copy-paste into your tool. Fonts like “Noto Sans Kannada” work well.
4. **Keep It Simple**:
   - Limit colors to 2-3 per slide (e.g., yellow, blue, white).
   - Use large, readable fonts (18pt+ for body text, 24pt+ for titles).
5. **Test It**:
   - View slides on a projector or screen to ensure visuals are clear from a distance.

## General Design Tips

- **Consistency**: Stick to a color palette (e.g., yellow, blue, orange) inspired by Karnataka’s flag or culture.

2. **Keep It Short**: Aim for 1-2 key points per slide. Avoid dense text (e.g., fix Slide 5’s garbled content—likely an OCR error).
3. **Tell a Story**: Add a personal touch, e.g., “We made Dhwani so our families could use voice tech in Kannada.” It’s relatable and memorable.
4. **Highlight Benefits**: Mention how working on Dhwani boosts skills or resumes—undergrads love practical takeaways.
5. **Practice Timing**: Keep it 10-15 minutes max to hold attention, leaving time for Q&A.

---

## Sample Flow
- **Start**: Hook them with a relatable scenario (Slide 1).
- **Middle**: Explain the problem (Slide 2), Dhwani’s solution (Slides 3-4), and its status (Slide 5).
- **End**: Show how they can explore it (Slides 6-9) and join in (Slides 10-11).

With these tweaks, your intro to Dhwani will be **fun**, **clear**, and **inspiring** for undergrads—sparking their interest in AI and Indian languages. Good luck with your presentation!
