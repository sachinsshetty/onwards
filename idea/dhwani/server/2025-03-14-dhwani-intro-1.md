## Revised Slides

### Slide 1: Introduction
- **Original**: "DNwAn - Voice AI / For Kannada / Indian Languages / slabstech.com/dhwani"
- **Revised**:
  - **Title**: “Meet Dhwani: Your Kannada-Speaking Voice Buddy!”
  - **Content**: “Imagine chatting with your phone in Kannada—Dhwani makes it happen!”
  - **Link**: slabstech.com/dhwani
- **Why**: A catchy, relatable hook grabs attention. “DNwAn” seems like a typo (should be “Dhwani”), and the original lacks an engaging opener.

- **Original**: Lists technical points about voice assistants lacking Indian language support.
- **Revised**:
  - **Title**: “Why We Need Dhwani”
  - **Content**:

    - “Over 50 million people speak Kannada, but most voice tech ignores them.”
    - “Dhwani uses free tools to fix this—built for YOU!”
- **Why**: Simplifies the problem into a relatable story, avoiding jargon like “OpenAI’s recent entry” and focusing on the human need.

## General Tips
1. **Add Visuals**: Include app screenshots, a demo clip of Dhwani responding in Kannada, or icons (e.g., microphone for ASR, speaker for TTS). Visuals break up text and make it lively.
2. **Keep It Short**: Aim for 1-2 key points per slide. Avoid dense text (e.g., fix Slide 5’s garbled content—likely an OCR error).
3. **Tell a Story**: Add a personal touch, e.g., “We made Dhwani so our families could use voice tech in Kannada.” It’s relatable and memorable.
4. **Highlight Benefits**: Mention how working on Dhwani boosts skills or resumes—undergrads love practical takeaways.
5. **Practice Timing**: Keep it 10-15 minutes max to hold attention, leaving time for Q&A.
