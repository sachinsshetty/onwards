<!-- 

- publications include lyrics,
meanings, and musical notations in Diacritical English, and also lyrics in Devanagar
- sing any of the
compositions from these books as per the notation, raga and tala given in these books.
Software needs to be trained to understand raga lakshanas to start with and then it
needs to be trained to understand the musical notations.

- adding the ability to render compositions in diï¬€erent instrumental voices like
veena, violin, flute, and sitar would significantly enhance the engine's utility
