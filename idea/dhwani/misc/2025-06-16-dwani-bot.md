dwani.ai - next phase 

Robots with dwani.ai would be the next step for me.

After participating in many AI Hackathon and the recent the LeRobot Hackathon.

 I observed that the market for Software AI has too many incumbent with the gap increasing with Capital allocation. The large wave has passed.

With Open source humanoid robotics, the market is just opening up with different possibilities and there are no clear winner's. The gap can be reduced with skills and less intensive capital allocation.

It would be great, if we could collaborate on the Open Source Humanoid Robotics. 

Germany has large talent with advanced manufacturing that can be leveraged to scale the idea .
