Space AI

- Create - Collision Avoid UI
- Create prototypes every month, iterate on 1 working idea.
- deploy the code and showcase your work as full-stack engineer
- Contribute to maintenance of Satnogs 
- gaganyatri.in - limit has reached with plain html +js
    - Rebuild project with stack as pathfinder
        - react + vite + material-ui
        - deploy generated code to GitHub
- Only web-dev will not get you to Mars. Only robotics designed for Space will 
make you eligible as Mission Specialist. Acutely follow the work and replicate GITAI mission.

starkink Mapper

Find all satellites that are covering a location.

Show what starlink satellite are providing network connectivity. 

Find locations which are under served.

Identity collision avoidance measures .
From past,
Present.
What actions to take.

Build a 3d map, where can the next satellites fit. Which regions are safe for satellite deployment. 


What regions or paths are necessary for National  security 


-- 

Version 1 - Build

1. Choose 1- satellites from Starlink. (version 2 - 10x)
2. Get the TLE from celestrak / space-track.org
3. Predict overpass for all the satellites from current location.
4. Find time when satellites are overhead.
5. Automate satnogs observations for Required satellites overpass.
