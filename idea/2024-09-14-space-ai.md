Space AI

- Create - Collision Avoid UI
- Create prototypes every month, iterate on 1 working idea.
- deploy the code and showcase your work as full-stack engineer
- Contribute to maintenance of Satnogs 
- gaganyatri.in - limit has reached with plain html +js
    - Rebuild project with stack as pathfinder
        - react + vite + material-ui
        - deploy generated code to GitHub
- Only web-dev will not get you to Mars. Only robotics designed for Space will 
make you eligible as Mission Specialist. Acutely follow the work and replicate GITAI mission.
