Customer interaction 

[21/11, 12:43] Developer: Hi 

I've started to build a simple Health tracking website. 

Link- sanjeevini.me

Let me know, if you are free and
can give me advice on what doctors would require for daily work.

[21/11, 13:09] Customer: You mean investigations?

[21/11, 13:14] Developer: Yes. 
The idea is to manage reports with voice ai.
It will listen to conversations and fill the forms. 
Errors will be reduced, 
final approval by Doctors. 


Later this data is analyzed and additonal information is provided .

Automate a bit of Diagnostics

[21/11, 16:21] Customer: Patient Doctor conversation is confidential. You cannot listen to it


[21/11, 16:24] Developer: Yes. We won't listen to it. 
Application will transcribe it without sharing the data outside.
It will be a closed system.

[21/11, 16:30] Developer: The system will be offline .
We use the GPU to do conversion locally. 

It's like alexa/siri/google but everything runs on the laptop.

[21/11, 16:31] Customer: I don't think any doctor will accept it

[21/11, 16:32] Developer: With a working demo,  they will see the advantage of utilizing it.

[21/11, 16:34] Developer: We will test the system with 
Simulated/synthetic audio.

Demo will include 
Uploading the file and see how it creates the report.


[21/11, 21:22] Doctor: It's not that simple. There are lot of rules in the medical field. U can't just test something without legal aid

[21/11, 21:36] Developer: Yes.  This will be done with legal permission before being deployed to a clinic/hospital.
