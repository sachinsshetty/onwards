Im interested to work on the agent AI OS.

I am creating a simple CRUD app for healthcare at https://sanjeevini.me 

This is to validate Agent operations for solving complex medical information. 

We need a UX for user/customers to validate their ideas.

GitHub portfolio: 
github.com/sachinsshetty 

I started with github.com/slabstech/llm-recipes to experiment with different AI use cases .

Then move to https://gaganyatri.in to showcase Multimodel use-case for human interaction. 

Currently I'm building https://sanjeevini.me to create Agents to for healthcare automation in developing countries with OpenSource development and Open core business Devleopment 

This will help for adoption and solve the problems for others , while also providing monetary benefits to sustain the project.
