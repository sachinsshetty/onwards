# Technical Specification Document: Kannada Voice Model Development Demo

## Project Overview

The Kannada Voice Model Development project aims to create a robust voice assistant solution for the Kannada language, leveraging open-source Large Language Models (LLMs) and tools from AI4BHARAT. The demo will showcase three core functionalities: Automatic Speech Recognition (ASR), Text-to-Speech (TTS), and translation services, tailored specifically for Kannada and extensible to other Indian languages. This technical specification outlines the system requirements, architecture, and deliverables for a functional demo to be developed over a three-month period with GPU access.

## Objectives

- Demonstrate real-time ASR for converting spoken Kannada into text.
- Showcase natural-sounding TTS for converting Kannada text into speech.
- Highlight translation capabilities between Kannada and at least one other Indian language (e.g., Hindi or Tamil).
- Prove scalability and performance using GPU-accelerated processing.
