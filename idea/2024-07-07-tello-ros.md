Tello Ros 

A demand exists for a workable solution using Tello Drone to solve Indoor navigation and maping. Current solutions are outdated and not actively maintained. 

Build a workable solution that is easy to use, easy to reproduce the idea.  Learn the basics, implement the solution step by step.
There is no urgency to finish the project. 

What is necessary is a workable product. Optimisation can come later, with daily increments the program can do a lot in a week and month. 
For this week, try to learn how to setup the ROS build, after this make an artifact to include the Tello drone.
