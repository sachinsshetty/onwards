## Mission Ops

Idea is to retrofit existing machine to work autonomously, 
rather than building everything from scratch

- Find all the components of Space stations
    - What are the machines ?
    - What problems are solved by machines ?
    - What problems need human assistance ?
    - What boundary conditions are present ?
    - How to make machine intelligent to work with each other ?
    - What Opensource/ Off the shelf components are used to build it ?

- How to build Pragyaan Rover ?
    - In cardboard
    - In Simulation - Gazebo/ROS 2
    - Connect the machine autonomously with Protocols
    - Experiments/ Instruments
    - Research published for all components

- Current projects
- Future projects
- Problems to solve ?
