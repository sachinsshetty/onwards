Automatioc Speech Recognition 2. Translation model 3. text LLM ( we will not initially work on this) 4. Text to Speech model</p> <p>For first month, We want to combine all the 4 systems and run it on a single GPU. We want to start with the lowest compute server, which can fit all the Model VRAM requirements and 5 minute audio / context VRAM requirement.</p> <p>Based on this baseline, we will convert the models to Triton kernel server. This needs investigation and effort.</p> <p>Once we successfully export all the models triton kernels, we will work on scaling it up with large instance and load balancing with multiple small instance.</p> <p>Multiple GPU requirement comes into play, if the model conversion fails due to lack of expertise. Then we will host the pytorch/transformer/uvicorn models.</p> <ol> <li>Evaluation harness will be done in the second months , if we observe that the accuracy is not good for daily use, then we will combine other available datasets to improve the model. Re-training is currently out of scope for the initial exploration since it will involve additional effort of people and compute resources.</li> </ol> <p>We want to first try how the existing models work , get it running with faster inference.</p> <p>\u2014-------</p> <p>Feb 27, 2025</p> <p>https://github.com/sachinsshetty/onwards/blob/main/idea/2025/2025-02-27-dhwani-research-milestones.md</p> <p>Dhwani -

It\u2019s a voice assistant that speaks fluent German, designed for Anna and millions like her. Open-source and privacy-first, Dhwani runs on-premise, keeping data secure. It answers queries like \u201cWas ist das Wetter in Berlin?\u201d with ease, supports translations, and describes images in German, making tech accessible to all, including those with disabilities.</p> <p>Our vision is simple: every German speaker\u2019s voice should be heard. Dhwani is tailored for Germany\u2019s 80 million, Austria\u2019s 9 million, and Switzerland\u2019s 5 million people, with potential to reach 300 million Europeans later. Unlike generic assistants, Dhwani is German-first, private, and community-driven, built with AI to understand dialects and deliver natural responses.</p> <p>We\u2019re already live on the Google Play Store, with 1,000+ German-speaking testers and growing open-source support.

Since you're leveraging an AI code assistant and working alone, I\u2019ll suggest improvements to optimize your time, energy, and productivity while ensuring steady progress. Here\u2019s a refined version of your schedule with actionable suggestions: Morning: Core Development Focus Current Plan: System design, new feature addition, customer acquisition Suggestions for Improvement: Prioritize System Design Early: Dedicate the first 1-2 hours (e.g., 9:00\u201311:00 AM) to system design. This is when your mind is likely freshest for high-level thinking. Break it into: 30-60 mins: Refine architecture (e.g., voice processing pipeline, scalability, API integrations). 30 mins: Sketch out technical requirements for new features. Use your AI code assistant to generate boilerplate code or validate design ideas (e.g., \u201cSuggest a scalable architecture for real-time voice processing\u201d). Shift New Feature Addition to a Focused Block: Allocate 2 hours (e.g., 11:00 AM\u20131:00 PM) for coding new features. Follow a mini-sprint approach: Pick 1-2 small, high-impact features daily. Test them immediately with the AI assistant\u2019s help (e.g., \u201cDebug this voice recognition module\u201d or \u201cOptimize this algorithm\u201d). Avoid multitasking\u2014finish a feature before moving to the next. Delay Customer Acquisition to Afternoon: As a solo developer, mornings should prioritize building the product. Move customer outreach (e.g., emails, pitches, social media) to later when your creative energy might dip. You\u2019ll have more to show after morning progress. Revised Morning: 9:00\u201311:00 AM: System design and planning 11:00 AM\u20131:00 PM: New feature coding and testing Afternoon: Communication and Polish Current Plan: Housekeeping, document release, demo videos, project updates Suggestions for Improvement: Streamline Housekeeping: Limit this to 30-60 mins (e.g., 2:00\u20133:00 PM). Focus on essential tasks: code cleanup, version control commits, or organizing files. Use your AI assistant to automate repetitive tasks (e.g., \u201cGenerate a changelog from my commits\u201d or \u201cFormat this documentation\u201d). Combine Demo Videos and Project Updates: Allocate 1-2 hours (e.g., 3:00\u20135:00 PM) for creating customer-facing content. Record a single short demo video (3-5 mins) showcasing a new feature or progress. Use simple tools like Loom or OBS. Repurpose the video script for project updates (e.g., blog post, newsletter, or X post). Let your AI assistant draft the text based on your video outline. Add Customer Acquisition Here: Spend 1 hour (e.g., 5:00\u20136:00 PM) on outreach: emailing potential users, posting on X about your startup, or engaging with voice-tech communities (e.g., Reddit, Discord). Ask your AI assistant to craft personalized pitch emails or analyze competitors\u2019 strategies for inspiration.

What do you think\u2014any specific areas you\u2019d like to tweak further?</p> <p>--</p> <p>level 2 - grok - deep think</p> <p>Your plan for building an AI startup for voice as a solo developer is ambitious and covers key areas like system design, feature development, customer acquisition, documentation, and collaboration. Since you're leveraging an AI code assistant and working alone, I\u2019ll suggest improvements to optimize your time, energy, and productivity while ensuring steady progress. Here\u2019s a refined version of your schedule with actionable suggestions: Morning: Core Development Focus Current Plan: System design, new feature addition, customer acquisition Suggestions for Improvement: Prioritize System Design Early: Dedicate the first 1-2 hours (e.g., 9:00\u201311:00 AM) to system design. This is when your mind is likely freshest for high-level thinking. Break it into: 30-60 mins: Refine architecture (e.g., voice processing pipeline, scalability, API integrations). 30 mins: Sketch out technical requirements for new features. Use your AI code assistant to generate boilerplate code or validate design ideas (e.g., \u201cSuggest a scalable architecture for real-time voice processing\u201d). Shift New Feature Addition to a Focused Block: Allocate 2 hours (e.g., 11:00 AM\u20131:00 PM) for coding new features. Follow a mini-sprint approach: Pick 1-2 small, high-impact features daily. Test them immediately with the AI assistant\u2019s help (e.g., \u201cDebug this voice recognition module\u201d or \u201cOptimize this algorithm\u201d). Avoid multitasking\u2014finish a feature before moving to the next. Delay Customer Acquisition to Afternoon: As a solo developer, mornings should prioritize building the product. Move customer outreach (e.g., emails, pitches, social media) to later when your creative energy might dip. You\u2019ll have more to show after morning progress. Revised Morning: 9:00\u201311:00 AM: System design and planning 11:00 AM\u20131:00 PM: New feature coding and testing Afternoon: Communication and Polish Current Plan: Housekeeping, document release, demo videos, project updates Suggestions for Improvement: Streamline Housekeeping: Limit this to 30-60 mins (e.g., 2:00\u20133:00 PM). Focus on essential tasks: code cleanup, version control commits, or organizing files. Use your AI assistant to automate repetitive tasks (e.g., \u201cGenerate a changelog from my commits\u201d or \u201cFormat this documentation\u201d). Combine Demo Videos and Project Updates: Allocate 1-2 hours (e.g., 3:00\u20135:00 PM) for creating customer-facing content. Record a single short demo video (3-5 mins) showcasing a new feature or progress. Use simple tools like Loom or OBS. Repurpose the video script for project updates (e.g., blog post, newsletter, or X post). Let your AI assistant draft the text based on your video outline. Add Customer Acquisition Here: Spend 1 hour (e.g., 5:00\u20136:00 PM) on outreach: emailing potential users, posting on X about your startup, or engaging with voice-tech communities (e.g., Reddit, Discord). Ask your AI assistant to craft personalized pitch emails or analyze competitors\u2019 strategies for inspiration.

What do you think\u2014any specific areas you\u2019d like to tweak further?</p> <p>--</p> <p>deep think - reasoning </p> <p>Revisit the plan to make a 1 million dollar annual profits from the product. Provide all the details in depth Thought for 1m 45s Collapse details</p> <ol> <li>Customer Acquisition Strategy</li> <li>Optimized Daily Schedule</li> <li>Milestones &amp; Adjustments</li> <li>Risks &amp; Mitigations By following this plan, leveraging your AI assistant, and staying adaptable, you can build a profitable voice AI startup. Good luck! Alright, so I have this AI startup for voice, and my goal is to make $1 million in annual profits. I'm the only developer, but I have an AI code assistant to help me out. Let's break this down step by step. First, I need to understand what it takes to make $1 million in profit. Profit is revenue minus expenses. So, I need to figure out how much revenue I need to generate to cover my expenses and still have $1 million left. Let's assume my expenses are relatively low since I'm a solo developer. I'll need to pay for things like: Server costs for hosting the AI models and processing voice data</li> </ol> <p>Marketing and advertising to acquire customers</p> <p>Tools and software subscriptions (e.g., IDEs, version control, etc.)</p> <p>Possibly some legal and accounting fees Let's estimate these costs. For server costs, if I'm using cloud services like AWS or Google Cloud for AI processing, that could be significant depending on the scale. Marketing can vary widely, but I'll need to invest in it to get users. Tools and software might be a few hundred dollars a month. Legal and accounting could be a few thousand a year. Let's say, conservatively, my annual expenses are around $200,000. That means to make $1 million in profit, I need $1.2 million in revenue. Now, how do I generate $1.2 million in revenue? I need to think about my product and pricing. Since it's a voice AI startup, possible products could be: A voice assistant for businesses</p> <p>Voice analytics for customer service</p> <p>Voice-to-text transcription services</p> <p>Custom voice AI solutions for enterprises Let's assume I'm going for a SaaS model, where customers pay a monthly or annual subscription. To make $1.2 million in annual revenue, I need to figure out how many customers I need and at what price point. For example: If I charge $100/month per customer, I need 1,000 customers to make $1.2 million annually (100 * 12 * 1000 = $1,200,000)</p> <p>If I charge $500/month, I need 200 customers (500 * 12 * 200 = $1,200,000)</p> <p>If I charge $1,000/month, I need 100 customers (1000 * 12 * 100 = $1,200,000) So, the number of customers needed decreases as the price increases, but it might be harder to acquire customers at higher price points. I need to find the sweet spot where the price is attractive to customers but also allows me to reach my revenue goal without needing an unrealistic number of customers. Let's say I aim for a price point of $500/month. That means I need 200 customers. Now, is 200 customers realistic? It depends on the market size and my ability to reach and convert potential customers. For a voice AI product, the market could be quite large, including businesses of various sizes across different industries. But as a solo developer, my capacity to handle a large number of customers might be limited, especially in terms of customer support and ongoing development. However, since it's a SaaS product, once the software is built, it can scale relatively easily, especially if I design it to be self-service with minimal support needed. Still, I need to ensure that I can handle the development, maintenance, and customer acquisition on my own, at least initially. Perhaps I can plan to hire help once I start generating revenue, but for now, I'll assume I'm doing everything myself. So, to acquire 200 customers, I need a solid marketing and sales strategy. Let's think about customer acquisition. Possible channels: Content marketing: blogging, SEO, webinars</p> <p>Social media marketing: Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.</p> <p>Paid advertising: Google Ads, Facebook Ads, etc.</p> <p>Partnerships and integrations with other platforms</p> <p>Referrals and word-of-mouth As a solo founder, content marketing might be a good starting point since it's cost-effective and can establish me as an authority in the voice AI space. I can write blog posts about voice AI, its applications, tutorials, etc., to attract potential customers. Additionally, I can leverage my AI code assistant to help with content creation, such as drafting articles or generating ideas. For paid advertising, I might need to invest some money, but I can start small and scale up as I see results. Let's estimate a customer acquisition cost (CAC). Suppose, on average, it costs me $1,000 to acquire a customer through marketing and sales efforts. Then, for 200 customers, that's $200,000 in acquisition costs, which fits within my earlier expense estimate. Wait, actually, in my initial expense estimate, I had $200,000 total expenses, which included server costs, tools, etc. So, if acquisition costs are $200,000, that might be too tight. Let's adjust. Perhaps my total expenses are higher. Let's say: Server costs: $50,000/year</p> <p>Marketing and advertising: $200,000/year</p> <p>Tools and software: $5,000/year</p> <p>Legal and accounting: $5,000/year Total expenses: $260,000/year Then, to make $1 million in profit, I need $1,260,000 in revenue. At $500/month per customer, that's about 210 customers (500 * 12 * 210 = $1,260,000). So, slightly more, but still manageable. Alternatively, I could aim for a higher price point or find ways to reduce expenses. Another way to look at it is to calculate the lifetime value (LTV) of a customer and ensure that LTV is significantly higher than CAC. Assuming an average customer stays for 2 years, then LTV at $500/month is 500 * 24 = $12,000. If CAC is $1,000, then LTV:CAC ratio is 12:1, which is excellent. Generally, a ratio of 3:1 or higher is considered good, so this seems sustainable. Now, let's think about the product itself. To charge $500/month, the product needs to provide significant value. For example, if it's a voice analytics tool for customer service, it could help businesses improve their customer satisfaction, reduce churn, or increase sales, which could easily justify $500/month. Similarly, a voice assistant for businesses could automate tasks, saving time and money. I need to ensure that the product solves a real pain point and that I can communicate its value effectively. Also, since I'm the only developer, I need to build a product that's maintainable and scalable. I should focus on building a minimum viable product (MVP) first, with the core features that provide the most value, and then iterate based on customer feedback. Using my AI code assistant, I can accelerate development by generating code snippets, debugging, and even designing parts of the system. For example, I can ask the assistant to: Generate API endpoints for voice processing</p> <p>Suggest database schemas for storing voice data</p> <p>Help with integrating third-party voice recognition APIs</p> <p>Optimize algorithms for voice processing This should help me build the product faster. Now, let's revisit my daily plan in light of this goal. Original plan: Morning: System design</p> <p>New feature addition</p> <p>Customer acquisition Afternoon: Housekeeping, document release</p> <p>Demo videos and project updates Night: External projects, code collaboration Since my goal is to build a product that generates $1 million in profit, I need to prioritize activities that directly contribute to that. Specifically: Building the product (system design, feature development)</p> <p>Acquiring customers (marketing, sales)</p> <p>Ensuring the product is stable and scalable (housekeeping, documentation)</p> <p>Learning and staying updated (external projects, collaboration) However, as a solo founder, I need to be careful not to spread myself too thin. Let's optimize the schedule. First, since building the product is crucial, I should dedicate a significant portion of my day to development. But I also need to allocate time for customer acquisition, as without customers, there's no revenue. Additionally, housekeeping and documentation are important for maintaining the product and attracting customers (e.g., through demo videos and updates). External projects and code collaboration might be less critical, especially if they don't directly contribute to my startup. Perhaps I can minimize time spent on external projects unless they provide significant learning or networking opportunities. Let's propose a revised schedule: Morning (8:00 AM - 12:00 PM): 8:00 - 9:00: Planning and system design</p> <p>9:00 - 12:00: Focused development (new features, bug fixes) Lunch (12:00 - 1:00 PM) Afternoon (1:00 - 5:00 PM): 1:00 - 2:00: Customer acquisition (e.g., writing blog posts, social media, outreach)</p> <p>2:00 - 3:00: Housekeeping (code cleanup, documentation)</p> <p>3:00 - 4:00: Demo videos and project updates</p> <p>4:00 - 5:00: Customer support and feedback analysis Evening (7:00 - 9:00 PM): 7:00 - 8:00: Learning and research (staying updated on voice AI trends)</p> <p>8:00 - 9:00: External projects or code collaboration (optional, only if beneficial) This schedule allocates 4 hours to development, 1 hour to customer acquisition, 1 hour to housekeeping, 1 hour to demos and updates, and 1 hour to customer support. In the evening, 1 hour for learning and 1 hour for external projects if needed. This seems balanced, but I might need to adjust based on actual progress. Also, since I'm using an AI code assistant, I can leverage it throughout the day for various tasks: During development: generating code, debugging, suggesting improvements</p> <p>For customer acquisition: drafting marketing copy, analyzing competitors</p> <p>For housekeeping: generating documentation, organizing code</p> <p>For demos: scripting video content</p> <p>For learning: summarizing articles, explaining concepts This should help me be more efficient. Now, to reach 200 customers, I need a plan for customer acquisition. Let's say I aim to launch the MVP in 3 months. During these 3 months, I can start building an audience through content marketing. For example: Write weekly blog posts about voice AI, its benefits, use cases, etc.</p> <p>Share these posts on social media and relevant communities</p> <p>Start an email newsletter to build a list of interested prospects</p> <p>Offer early access or beta testing to gather feedback and create buzz Once the MVP is ready, I can start converting these leads into paying customers. Assuming a conversion rate of 5%, meaning 5% of leads become customers. To get 200 customers, I need 4,000 leads. If I can generate 100 leads per week through content marketing, it would take 40 weeks to get 4,000 leads. But that's almost a year, which might be too slow. Alternatively, I can supplement with paid advertising. Suppose I run Google Ads or LinkedIn Ads targeting businesses interested in AI or voice technology. If I can get leads at $10 per lead, then 4,000 leads would cost $40,000. With a 5% conversion rate, that's 200 customers. But earlier, I estimated CAC at $1,000 per customer, which for 200 customers is $200,000. Wait, if I spend $40,000 on ads to get 4,000 leads, and 5% convert, that's 200 customers, so CAC is $200 per customer ($40,000 / 200). Wait, that seems inconsistent with my earlier assumption. Actually, in my initial calculation, I had CAC at $1,000, but that might be too high. Let's clarify. Typically, for SaaS businesses, CAC can vary, but for a $500/month product, a CAC of $1,000 might be acceptable if the LTV is high. In my earlier example, LTV is $12,000 (assuming 2-year retention), so CAC of $1,000 is fine. But in the ad scenario, if I can get customers at $200 CAC, that's even better. However, the conversion rate might be lower for cold leads from ads compared to warm leads from content marketing. Let's assume a lower conversion rate for ads, say 2%. Then, to get 200 customers, I need 10,000 leads at 2% conversion. At $10 per lead, that's $100,000 for 10,000 leads, resulting in 200 customers, so CAC is $500 per customer. Still acceptable, since LTV is $12,000. So, a combination of content marketing and paid ads could work. For instance: Content marketing: generate 50 leads per week, over 6 months (26 weeks), that's 1,300 leads. At 5% conversion, 65 customers.</p> <p>Paid ads: spend $50,000 to get 5,000 leads at $10 each. At 2% conversion, 100 customers.</p> <p>Total customers: 65 + 100 = 165, close to 200. Then, through referrals and organic growth, I can reach 200. This seems plausible. Of course, these numbers are estimates, and I'll need to track and adjust based on actual performance. Additionally, I should focus on customer retention to maximize LTV. Providing excellent customer support, continuously improving the product based on feedback, and adding new features that customers want. Since I'm the only developer, I need to be efficient with my time. Perhaps I can allocate some time each week to customer support and feedback analysis, as in the schedule above. Also, I can use automation tools to handle some support tasks, like chatbots or FAQ sections. Moreover, since it's a voice AI product, I can use my own technology to provide voice-based support, which could be a unique selling point. Now, let's think about the development timeline. To launch an MVP in 3 months, I need to define what features are essential. For a voice AI product, core features might include: Voice recognition and processing</p> <p>Natural language understanding</p> <p>Integration with common platforms (e.g., CRM, customer service tools)</p> <p>Analytics and reporting I should prioritize the features that provide the most value to customers and differentiate my product from competitors. I can use my AI code assistant to help with rapid prototyping and testing. For example, I can ask it to generate code for connecting to voice APIs, processing audio data, etc. Once the MVP is launched, I can start onboarding beta users, gather feedback, and iterate. During this phase, I need to balance development with customer acquisition and support. After reaching, say, 50 customers, I might consider hiring a part-time support person or a marketing assistant to help with growth. But initially, I'll handle everything myself. Financially, I need to ensure I have enough runway to sustain myself until the business becomes profitable. Assuming I have savings or external funding to cover my personal expenses and the initial business expenses. Let's say I need $50,000 for the first year to cover living expenses and business costs before generating significant revenue. Then, once I start getting customers, the revenue can cover ongoing expenses and eventually lead to profit. To summarize the plan: Build an MVP for a voice AI SaaS product in 3 months, focusing on core features that solve a specific pain point for businesses.</p> <p>During development, start content marketing to build an audience and generate leads.</p> <p>Launch the MVP and convert leads to beta users, gather feedback, and iterate.</p> <p>Supplement with paid advertising to accelerate customer acquisition.</p> <p>Aim for 200 customers at $500/month to generate $1.2 million in annual revenue.</p> <p>Keep expenses under control, estimated at $260,000 annually, to achieve $1 million in profit.</p> <p>Use the AI code assistant extensively to speed up development, marketing, and support tasks.</p> <p>Continuously improve the product based on customer feedback to ensure high retention and satisfaction. This seems like a viable plan, but it will require disciplined execution and constant monitoring of key metrics like customer acquisition rate, conversion rates, churn rate, etc. I should also be prepared to pivot or adjust the strategy if things don't go as planned. For example, if customer acquisition is slower than expected, I might need to explore partnerships or alternative marketing channels. Alternatively, if the product-market fit isn't strong, I might need to refine the product or target a different market segment. But with persistence and adaptability, reaching $1 million in annual profit is achievable. Wait a minute, one thing I haven't considered is the competition. In the voice AI space, there are established players like Google, Amazon, Microsoft, as well as startups. I need to differentiate my product by focusing on a specific niche or offering unique features. For instance, perhaps I can target small to medium-sized businesses that can't afford enterprise solutions, or focus on a particular industry like healthcare or finance where voice AI can provide significant value. Additionally, since I'm a solo founder, I can be more agile and responsive to customer needs compared to larger companies. I can also offer personalized support and customization, which might be appealing to certain customers. Another angle is to make the product extremely easy to use, with minimal setup, which could attract non-technical users. Moreover, leveraging the latest advancements in AI, I can ensure my product is cutting-edge and offers superior performance. For example, using advanced neural networks for voice recognition or natural language processing. I can also explore open-source models and tools to reduce costs and speed up development. In terms of pricing, I might consider a tiered model with different plans for different customer sizes or feature sets. For example: Basic plan: $200/month for small businesses with limited features</p> <p>Pro plan: $500/month for medium businesses with advanced features</p> <p>Enterprise plan: custom pricing for large businesses with additional support and customization This way, I can cater to a wider range of customers and potentially increase the average revenue per customer. Assuming a mix of customers across tiers, I might be able to reach the revenue goal with fewer customers if some are on higher tiers. For instance, if I have 100 customers on the Pro plan ($500/month) and 50 on the Enterprise plan (say, $1,000/month), that's 10050012 + 50100012 = $600,000 + $600,000 = $1.2 million. Wait, actually, 10050012 = $600,000; 50100012 = $600,000; total $1.2 million, yes. So, with 150 customers, I can reach the revenue goal if some are on higher tiers. This might be more achievable than 200 customers on a single tier. Therefore, offering multiple pricing tiers could be beneficial. In conclusion, by carefully planning the product development, customer acquisition strategy, and leveraging the AI code assistant, I can work towards building a voice AI startup that generates $1 million in annual profit. It will require dedication, hard work, and adaptability, but it's a realistic goal.

Product Development (MVP in 3 Months) Focus on Core Features: Voice recognition and processing.</p> <p>Natural language understanding.</p> <p>Integration with popular platforms (e.g., CRM, customer service tools).</p> <p>Analytics and reporting. Leverage AI Assistant: Generate API endpoints, database schemas, and third-party integrations.</p> <p>Optimize voice processing algorithms.</p> <p>Automate testing and debugging. Differentiate: Target SMBs or specific industries (e.g., healthcare, finance).</p> <p>Offer superior ease of use, customization, or niche features. 3. Customer Acquisition Strategy Content Marketing (Ongoing): Write weekly blog posts on voice AI benefits, use cases, and tutorials.</p> <p>Share on social media (X, LinkedIn) and communities (Reddit, Discord).</p> <p>Build an email list for early access and beta testing. Paid Advertising: Use Google/LinkedIn ads targeting AI-interested businesses.</p> <p>Aim for 5,000 leads at ~$10/lead with a 2% conversion rate (100 customers). Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC): Target $500-$1,000 per customer.</p> <p>With LTV of $12,000 (assuming 2-year retention), maintain a healthy LTV:CAC ratio. Retention: Provide excellent support (use your own voice AI for customer service).</p> <p>Continuously improve based on feedback. 4. Optimized Daily Schedule Morning (8:00 AM - 12:00 PM): 8:00-9:00 AM: Planning and system design.</p> <p>9:00 AM-12:00 PM: Focused development (features, bug fixes). Afternoon (1:00 PM - 5:00 PM): 1:00-2:00 PM: Customer acquisition (content creation, outreach).</p> <p>2:00-3:00 PM: Housekeeping (code cleanup, documentation).</p> <p>3:00-4:00 PM: Demo videos and project updates.</p> <p>4:00-5:00 PM: Customer support and feedback analysis. Evening (7:00 PM - 9:00 PM): 7:00-8:00 PM: Learning and research (voice AI trends).</p> <p>8:00-9:00 PM: External projects (optional, if beneficial). 5. Milestones &amp; Adjustments Months 1-3: Build MVP, start content marketing, and generate initial leads.</p> <p>Month 4: Launch MVP, onboard beta users, and gather feedback.</p> <p>Months 5-12: Scale customer acquisition (ads + content), aim for 50 customers by month 6, 100 by month 9, and 200 by month 12.</p> <p>Monitor Metrics: Track CAC, conversion rates, churn, and customer feedback. Adjust marketing or product features as needed. 6. Risks &amp; Mitigations Competition: Differentiate by targeting underserved markets or offering unique features.</p> <p>Scalability: Design for self-service and automation to minimize support needs.</p> <p>Burnout: Stick to the schedule, take breaks, and consider hiring part-time help after reaching 50 customers. By following this plan, leveraging your AI assistant, and staying adaptable, you can build a profitable voice AI startup. Good luck!</p>"},{"location":"2025/03/2025-03-05-march-madness/","title":"2025 03 05 march madness","text":"<p>Dhwani AI stack </p> <p>We will create the best User and Developer product tailored completely for Indian languages. </p> <p>By building it in public and making it MIT License,  we want more people to get away from closed AI like Google/OpenAI.</p> <p>Your data, Your AI.</p> <p>Online Workshops will begin from next week, we will show you can set Dhwani AI stack at your servers/laoptop.</p> <p>We have a billion plus population who are missing out on AI adoption, free services by large companies are data collection efforts. </p> <p>Welcome to March madness, where will iterate rapidly and have tailor made solution  for every India language,  developed with Open Source. </p>"},{"location":"2025/03/2025-03-08-dhwani-open-source/","title":"2025 03 08 dhwani open source","text":"<p>The gifts of Laxmi reduce as you share your wealth. </p> <p>The gifts of Saraswati increase as your share your knowledge.</p> <p>Source for Android app  and Python server.</p> <p>You can build your own android client and server.</p> <p>Or use Dhwani android app,</p> <p>Run the server on your local machine.

Theodore Roosevelt expressed this concept well in his \"Man in the Arena\" statement:</p> <p>\"It is not the critic who counts, not the one who points out how the strong man stumbled or how the doer of deeds might have done them better. The credit belongs to the man who is actually in the arena, whose face is marred with sweat and dust and blood; who strives valiantly; who errs and comes short again and again; who knows the great enthusiasms, the great devotions, and spends himself in a worthy cause; who, if he wins, knows the triumph of high achievement; and who, if he fails, at least fails while daring greatly, so that his place shall never be with those cold and timid souls who know neither victory nor defeat.\" </p>"},{"location":"docs/","title":"Welcome to MkDocs","text":"<p>For full documentation visit mkdocs.org.</p>"},{"location":"docs/#commands","title":"Commands","text":"<ul> <li><code>mkdocs new [dir-name]</code> -

This work introduces \"Track Me Not,\" a novel on-board computing framework for fast conjunction prediction and satellite pass forecasting. We extend traditional pass-predict algorithms by integrating historical orbital data from Space-Track.org and crowdsourced telemetry from SATNOGS, enabling massive-scale real-time computations to generate dynamic global maps of satellites and Objects of Interest (OOI).</p> <p>The core algorithm predicts collision paths using orbit propagation models, extended to track overhead satellites at arbitrary ground locations for amateur radio telemetry. Operators can leverage predicted paths to select and monitor overhead passes, optimizing listening schedules and maintenance planning.
